# Quest System V3 - Implementation Complete ✅

## Executive Summary
The Quest System V3 has been successfully implemented, transforming the platform from an admin-reviewed submission system to a self-directed, evidence-based learning platform with social collaboration features.

### 1. Task-Based Quest System
- **Granular XP Awards**: Each quest broken into specific tasks with individual XP values
- **Evidence Requirements**: All task completions require proof (text/link/image/video)

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars and completion percentages

### 2. Collaboration System
- **Team-Up Feature**: Students can invite friends to collaborate on quests
- **2x XP Bonus**: Both collaborators earn double XP for all completed tasks
- **Friend System Integration**: Checks for existing friendships before allowing invitations
- **Invitation Management**: Accept/decline system with status tracking

### 3. Learning Logs
- **Process Documentation**: Time-stamped entries for reflection and progress tracking
- **Media Support**: Optional image/video attachments for visual documentation
- **Bonus Incentives**: Consistent logging rewarded with bonus XP
- **Public Showcase**: Logs visible on diploma page for transparency

### 4. Evidence System
- **Multiple Types**: Support for text, links, images, and videos
- **Validation**: Client and server-side validation for all evidence types
- **File Upload**: Secure handling with size limits and type restrictions
- **Permanent Record**: All evidence stored and displayed on diploma page
