## Issues Identified

### Security Vulnerabilities (3 Critical)
1. **JWT stored in localStorage** - Vulnerable to XSS attacks
2. **Weak secret keys** - Some environments use weak secrets
3. **Missing input validation** - SQL injection risks in several endpoints

### Performance Issues (High Impact)
1. **N+1 queries** in quest listing - 2-4 second delays
2. **Missing database indexes** - 1-3 second query delays
3. **React re-rendering** - 500ms-2s UI lag during filtering

### Code Quality Issues
1. **Files too large** - admin_v3.py (1720 lines), AdminPage.jsx (1958 lines)
2. **Business logic in routes** - Should be in service layer
