Optio Quests Application PRD (Product Requirements Document)Version: 1.7Date: August 23, 2025Author: Brainstormer & Optio Founder1. Introduction & VisionThis document outlines the requirements for the new B2C version of the Optio Quests application, the engine behind the "Optio Pathways" program.The mission of Optio is to reignite student motivation by creating autonomous learning environments grounded in choice. The Optio Quests application is the digital manifestation of this mission. It is a web-based platform that allows students worldwide to turn their passions and real-world activities into a personalized educational journey. It gamifies learning through a system of "Quests," Experience Points (XP), and community collaboration, allowing it to supplement traditional schooling or serve as a complete, self-directed educational solution.The core philosophy is to empower students with autonomy (the ability to choose their path), competence (the ability to master challenges), and relatedness (the need to connect with others).2. Goals & ObjectivesUser Goal: To pursue learning that is meaningful and interesting to them, and to receive recognition for their achievements.Business Goal 1 (Acquisition): Attract a large user base with a compelling free tier that showcases the value of interest-led learning.Business Goal 2 (Conversion): Convert free users to the paid "Creator" subscription by offering valuable features like official credit banking and community bonuses.Business Goal 3 (Retention): Retain subscribers by providing a rich Quest library, a strong community, and tangible evidence of progress (transcripts, portfolios).3. User PersonasThe Explorer (Free User): A student using the platform for enrichment. They are curious and want to track personal growth but are not yet seeking official credit.The Creator (Subscriber): A homeschooler, "unschooler," or highly motivated student using Optio Quests as a core part of their education. They need to track official credits for a transcript and are motivated by community features.The Visionary (Premium Subscriber): A family seeking a complete, high-support educational solution. They need a direct, long-term relationship with a dedicated Educator.The Educator (Internal User): An Optio educator who reviews Quest submissions, provides feedback, and (for Visionaries) manages a caseload of students, helping them build their MAPs (My Achievement Plan).The Admin (Internal User): An Optio staff member with super-user privileges to manage quests, users, subscriptions, and site content.The Parent/Guardian (Future Persona): The parent of a student user who is likely the primary subscriber. They are invested in their child's progress and need high-level visibility to feel confident in the platform's value.4. Technology StackBackend Framework: Flask (Python). The backend will serve as a REST API that provides data to the frontend.Frontend Framework: React (JavaScript). The frontend will be a Single-Page Application (SPA) that communicates with the Flask API. This will provide the modern, interactive, app-like experience required.Database & BaaS: SupabaseSupabase Auth: For user registration and login.Supabase Database (Postgres): For storing all data (users, quests, submissions, etc.).Supabase Storage: For user-uploaded evidence files.Payment Processing: StripeDeployment: Vercel (ideal for React frontends) or Heroku.5. Design System & Style GuideOverall Vibe: Clean, motivational, encouraging, and slightly gamified. The design should feel modern, spacious, and intuitive, like a productivity app but with a playful and adventurous spirit.Color Palette:Primary Action: #6A4C93 (a deep, encouraging purple)Secondary/Accent: #FFCA3A (a vibrant, friendly yellow)Background: #F8F9FA (a very light, clean gray)Text: #212529 (a dark, readable charcoal)Borders/Dividers: #DEE2E6 (a light, neutral gray)Typography:Font Family: 'Inter', a clean and readable sans-serif font.H1 (Page Titles): 32px, boldH2 (Section Titles): 24px, semi-boldBody Text: 16px, regularLayout & Spacing:The layout should be spacious with generous whitespace to promote focus and reduce clutter.Use a consistent 8px grid system for all margins, padding, and spacing (e.g., 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px).Core Components:Buttons: Primary buttons should have a solid purple (#6A4C93) background, white text, 8px rounded corners, and a subtle box-shadow that grows slightly on hover. Padding should be 12px 16px.Cards: Used for Quests, dashboard widgets, etc. Cards should have a white background, a light gray (#DEE2E6) border, 12px rounded corners, and a soft box-shadow to "lift" them off the page. Internal padding should be 16px.Input Fields: Should have a light gray (#DEE2E6) border, 8px rounded corners, and a clear focus state (e.g., a purple border).6.

Non-Functional RequirementsPerformance:Page Load: All pages must achieve a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of under 2.5 seconds.API Response Time: All API endpoints must respond in under 500ms under normal load.Security:All user passwords must be securely hashed using Supabase Auth's built-in mechanisms.The application must be protected against common web vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.Row Level Security (RLS) must be enabled in Supabase to ensure users can only access and modify their own data.Scalability:The application architecture must be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling.The database schema should be indexed appropriately for common queries to ensure performance as data grows.The system should be designed to handle 1,000 concurrent users in its initial version.9.

Error Handling & Edge CasesFile Uploads: Gracefully handle failures with clear user messages without data loss.Payments: Provide clear error messages for declined payments and guide users to update information.API Failures: The frontend must handle API errors gracefully, showing loading states or error messages instead of a broken UI.User Input: Validate all user input on both client and server sides.11. Accessibility (a11y)The application must comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.This includes providing alt text, ensuring keyboard navigability, maintaining high color contrast, and using semantic HTML.12.
