# Optio Brand Guidelines for Designers

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## About Optio

Optio is an educational platform where students create self-validated diplomas through completing quests. We help students build impressive portfolios by documenting their learning journey with public evidence. Our mission is centered on the philosophy: **"The Process Is The Goal"** - celebrating the journey of learning, not just the destination.

## Brand Colors

### Primary Brand Colors

**Optio Purple**
- **Hex:** `#6D469B`
- **Usage:** Primary brand color, backgrounds, headers, graphics
- **Darker variant (for depth/shadows):** `#5A3A82`

**Optio Pink**
- **Hex:** `#EF597B`
- **Usage:** Primary brand color, accents, highlights, graphics
- **Darker variant (for depth/shadows):** `#E73862`

### Color Usage Notes

These two colors are the heart of our brand identity. They should be used prominently in all branded materials. They work beautifully together as a gradient (see below) or can be used individually for variety.

### Supporting Colors - Skill Pillars

Our platform is built around five skill pillars, each with its own color for visualization:

- **STEM:** Blue tones (representing logic, science, technology)
- **Wellness:** Green tones (representing health, balance, growth)
- **Communication:** Orange tones (representing connection, expression)
- **Civics:** Purple tones (representing community, responsibility)
- **Art:** Pink/magenta tones (representing creativity, expression)

These pillar colors can be used as accents but should not overpower the primary purple and pink brand colors.

1. **Bold (700)** - For main headlines, impactful statements, primary emphasis

## Brand Gradient

### The Optio Gradient

Our signature visual element is a **left-to-right gradient** from purple to pink:

**Gradient Specification:**
- **Start color (left):** `#6D469B` (Optio Purple)
- **End color (right):** `#EF597B` (Optio Pink)
- **Direction:** Left to right (horizontal)

### Where to Use the Gradient

The gradient should be prominently featured in:
- **Shirt designs** (consider as background element, accent stripe, or graphic element)
- Headers and hero graphics
- Primary call-to-action elements
- Decorative elements and borders
- Brand graphics and illustrations

### Visual Impact

The purple-to-pink gradient is **THE** most recognizable element of our brand. When in doubt, use the gradient to make designs feel distinctly "Optio."

## Design Philosophy & Brand Voice

### Core Philosophy: "The Process Is The Goal"

Everything we do celebrates the **journey of learning**, not just the end result. This philosophy should inform design choices:

- **Present-focused:** Celebrate what's happening NOW, not future promises
- **Process over product:** Value the steps taken, not just achievements
- **Internal motivation:** Focus on how learning FEELS, not how it LOOKS to others
- **Growth mindset:** Every attempt, mistake, and effort is valuable

### Language & Messaging

When incorporating text into designs, use language that reflects our philosophy:

**✅ USE (Present-focused, process-oriented):**
- "You are learning"
- "Your journey"
- "Exploring"
- "Currently growing"
- "Learning in action"
- "The process is the goal"

**❌ AVOID (Future-focused, outcome-oriented):**
- "You will achieve"
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Future success"
- "Get into college"
- "Achieve your goals"

### Target Audience

Our primary users are **teenagers** (ages 13-18), so designs should feel:
- **Modern and fresh** - Current design trends
- **Energetic but not childish** - Respect their maturity
- **Inclusive and diverse** - Represent all types of learners
- **Empowering** - They're in control of their learning
