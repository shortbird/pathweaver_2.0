## System Design Notes

**Core Data Structures:**
- The Badge system is an abstraction layer built upon the existing Quest architecture.
- The fundamental structure of a `Quest` (defined in `quests`) composed of multiple `Tasks` (defined in `quest_tasks`) is preserved.
- Badge completion logic (e.g., "complete any 5 of 10 quests") is handled in the `badge_service` and does not alter the individual quest completion workflow.

**Frontend Navigation Strategy:**
- The `ProfilePage` acts as the central navigation hub.
- `BadgeExplorer.jsx` (`/badges`) is the primary entry point for discovering long-term learning goals and structured paths (Badges).
- `QuestHub.jsx` (`/quests`) coexists and serves as a library for finding individual, standalone activities that may not be part of a badge.

**AI Badge-Quest Linking:**
- **Analysis Criteria**:
  - Pillar Alignment (0-100%): How well quest pillars match badge primary pillar
