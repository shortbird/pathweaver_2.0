## Constellation View Technical Implementation

**Session Date:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and deployed to develop

### Visual Design
**Pillar Orbs (5 Learning Pillars):**
- Pure light with lens flare effect (horizontal, vertical, diagonal cross patterns)
- Size: 60-140px based on total XP (0-3000 XP range)
- Brightness: 0.5-1.0 based on XP
- Colors: STEM (blue), Society (purple), Arts (pink), Language (orange), Life (green)
- Pentagon formation, starting from top
- Hover: 15% scale with smooth transition
- Active state: pulsing brightness animation

**Quest Orbs (Completed & In-Progress Quests):**
- Small orbs: 8-20px based on total quest XP
- Color blending from contributing pillars via XP distribution
- Gravitational positioning: weighted average of pillar positions
- Deterministic orbit offset (30-70px) based on quest ID hash
- Opacity: 1.0 for completed, 0.7 for in-progress
- Gentle bobbing animation
- Hover: 30% scale with smooth transition

### Positioning Algorithm
**Pillar Positions:**
```javascript
Pentagon formation with responsive radius:
- baseRadius = min(width, height) * 0.3
- radius = clamp(150, baseRadius, 400)
- angle = (index * 2œÄ / 5) - œÄ/2 (starting from top)
```

**Quest Gravitational Positioning:**
```javascript
1. Weighted average of pillar positions based on XP distribution
2. Add deterministic orbit offset (hash-based)
3. Enforce minimum 80px distance from all pillars
4. Iterative repulsion algorithm (max 20 iterations)
```

### Interactive Features
**Time Travel (Press T):**
- Slider appears at bottom
- Filters quests by completion/start date
- Scrub through learning history
- Date range: earliest quest to now

**Zoom & Pan:**
- Zoom: Ctrl/Cmd + scroll (0.5x - 3x)
- Pan: Shift + drag
- UI controls in right sidebar
- Reset view button
- Starfield 3x viewport to support zoom-out

**Hover System:**
- Pillar hover: shows name and total XP
- Quest hover: shows title, status, XP breakdown by pillar
- Mutual exclusion: hovering one type clears the other
- Reliable mouse leave detection via separated hitbox/visual

**Visual Effects:**
- Static background starfield (200 twinkling stars)
- Pentagon constellation lines connecting pillars
- Quest-to-pillar connecting lines (dashed, opacity by XP contribution)
- Particle trails flowing from quests to pillars
- Parallax disabled (was too distracting)

### Bug Fixes Applied
**Hover Card Issues:**
- Root cause: Framer Motion whileHover on same element as mouse events
- Solution: Separate hitbox container from visual scaling div
- Hitbox: fixed dimensions with explicit positioning
- Visual: inner div with pointerEvents: 'none' and CSS transition

**Quest Orb Coverage:**
- Issue: Pillar hitboxes covering nearby quest orbs
- Solution 1: Quest orbs have higher z-index (20/60 vs 10/50)
- Solution 2: Minimum 80px distance enforcement
- Solution 3: Reduced pillar hitbox to match visual size

**Alignment:**
- Issue: Orbs not centered at pentagon vertices
- Solution: Explicit pixel calculation instead of CSS transform percentage

**Parallax:**
- Issue: Background stars moving too fast (canvas 3x viewport)
- Solution: Completely disabled parallax on starfield

### Component Architecture
**Created Files:**
- `ConstellationView.jsx` - Main orchestration component
- `PillarOrb.jsx` - Pillar orb with lens flare
- `QuestOrb.jsx` - Quest orb with color blending
- `PillarInfoCard.jsx` - Pillar hover tooltip
- `QuestTooltip.jsx` - Quest hover tooltip
- `ConstellationLines.jsx` - Pentagon lines (SVG)
- `QuestPillarLines.jsx` - Quest-to-pillar lines (SVG)
- `StarField.jsx` - Background stars (Canvas)
- `ParticleTrail.jsx` - Particle system (Canvas)
- `TimeTravelSlider.jsx` - Time travel UI
- `ZoomPanControls.jsx` - Zoom/pan UI
- `ConstellationExit.jsx` - Exit button

**API Integration:**
- Fetches from `/api/users/dashboard` for pillar XP
- Fetches from `/api/users/completed-quests` for quest data
- Processes quest tasks to calculate XP distributions
- Handles both completed and in-progress quests

### Performance Optimizations
- All components use React.memo
- Canvas rendering for stars and particles
- SVG for lines (GPU-accelerated)
- Deterministic positioning (no random on each render)
- Static starfield (no parallax recalculation)

- `/badges` - Badge explorer
- `/badges/:badgeId` - Badge detail
- `/constellation` - Star map visualization
- `/badge-progress` - Progress dashboard
- `/credits` - Credit tracking
- `/transcript` - Academic transcript
- `/diploma` - Portfolio with earned badges
