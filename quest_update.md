## Vision
Transform Optio from loosely-structured quest browsing into a **badge-driven cognitive playground** with AI-maintained content library, providing just enough structure for personalized learning without eliminating creativity.

I will run any SQL directly in supabase. give me those scripts directly.

this is a completely new feature, separate from any existing features. It will be accessible through a new link in the navigation bar. do not edit or do anything that would impact functionality of existing features.

## Architecture Changes

### Phase 1: Database Schema & Badge System Foundation (Week 1)

**New Tables to Create:**

1. **badges** - Identity-based learning paths ("I am a...", "I can...")
   - id (UUID, PK)
   - name (VARCHAR) - e.g., "Creative Storyteller", "Systems Thinker"
   - identity_statement (VARCHAR) - "I am a...", "I can...", "I have..."
   - description (TEXT) - Engaging description of the badge
   - pillar_primary (VARCHAR) - Primary skill pillar
   - pillar_weights (JSONB) - e.g., `{STEM: 60, Society: 40}`
   - min_quests (INT) - Minimum quests to complete (default 5)
   - min_xp (INT) - Minimum XP required (default 1500)
   - portfolio_requirement (TEXT) - Special portfolio piece needed
   - ai_generated (BOOLEAN) - Whether AI created this badge
   - created_at (TIMESTAMP)
   - status (ENUM: active/beta/archived) - Badge availability status

2. **user_badges** - Enhanced to track badge pursuit/completion
   - EXISTING: id, user_id, badge_type, badge_name, badge_description, badge_icon_url, badge_data, earned_at
   - ADD: badge_id (FK to badges table)
   - ADD: is_active (BOOLEAN) - Currently pursuing this badge
   - ADD: progress_percentage (INT) - 0-100% completion
   - ADD: started_at (TIMESTAMP) - When user selected badge
   - ADD: completed_at (TIMESTAMP) - When badge earned
   - ADD: quests_completed (INT) - Count of quests done
   - ADD: xp_earned (INT) - XP earned toward this badge

3. **quest_templates** - Reusable quest patterns for AI generation
   - id (UUID, PK)
   - goal_statement (TEXT) - Main learning objective
   - applicable_badges (UUID[]) - Array of badge IDs this quest counts toward
   - difficulty_level (ENUM: beginner/intermediate/advanced)
   - estimated_xp (INT) - Expected total XP
   - estimated_hours (DECIMAL) - Time estimate
   - credit_mappings (JSONB) - e.g., `{math: 0.2, science: 0.3}`
   - resources (JSONB[]) - Learning resources array
   - ai_generated (BOOLEAN)
   - usage_count (INT) - How many students used this
   - success_rate (DECIMAL) - Completion rate
   - created_at (TIMESTAMP)

NOTES: call it complexity level, not difficulty level

here's the basic flow of an AI quest generation done by a user. notice how different tasks are given as options that can be accepted by the user:

Quest Creation with AI
Step 1: Goal Selection
Choose your quest type:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Create Something                     │
│ Learn from Course                   │
│ Improve Something                   │
│ Custom Quest                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
Step 2: AI Customization
Quest Goal: "Design a board game"

**Schema Migrations:**
```sql
-- Add badge relationship to existing quests table
ALTER TABLE quests ADD COLUMN applicable_badges JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;

-- Quest tasks already have subject_xp_distribution JSONB
-- Credits are calculated from XP: 1000 XP = 1 credit
-- No additional column needed, use existing subject_xp_distribution

-- Enhance user_badges table
ALTER TABLE user_badges
  ADD COLUMN badge_id UUID REFERENCES badges(id),
  ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  ADD COLUMN progress_percentage INT DEFAULT 0,
  ADD COLUMN started_at TIMESTAMP,
  ADD COLUMN completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  ADD COLUMN quests_completed INT DEFAULT 0,
  ADD COLUMN xp_earned INT DEFAULT 0;

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_badge_quests_badge ON badge_quests(badge_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_badge_quests_quest ON badge_quests(quest_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_badges_active ON user_badges(user_id, is_active) WHERE is_active = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_credit_ledger_user_year ON credit_ledger(user_id, academic_year);
CREATE INDEX idx_quests_applicable_badges ON quests USING gin(applicable_badges);

├── __init__.py
├── scheduler.py              # Main scheduling logic
├── content_generation_worker.py
├── quality_monitor.py
└── badge_maintenance.py
```

**1. `backend/jobs/scheduler.py`** - Main scheduled task coordinator
```python
"""
Daily AI Content Schedule:
- 02:00 AM: analyze_yesterday_usage()
- 06:00 AM: generate_morning_content()

Weekly Schedule:
- Monday: generate_quest_batch(50)
- Wednesday: create_new_badges(2-3)
- Friday: full_library_audit()
- Sunday: prepare_weekly_recommendations()
"""

class ContentScheduler:
    def run_scheduled_tasks():
        """Main entry point for scheduled jobs"""

    def analyze_yesterday_usage():
        """Process previous day's metrics"""

    def generate_morning_content():
        """Create new content for the day"""
```

**2. `backend/jobs/content_generation_worker.py`** - Background processing
```python
class ContentGenerationWorker:
    def process_generation_queue():
        """Process queued generation requests"""
        # - Pull from generation queue
        # - Call AI service
        # - Validate quality
        # - Store results
        # - Update metrics

    def retry_failed_generations():
        """Retry failed AI generations"""

    def publish_approved_content():
        """Move approved content to production"""
```

**3. `backend/jobs/quality_monitor.py`** - Content quality assurance
```python
class QualityMonitor:
    def audit_ai_content():
        """Check quality of AI-generated content"""
        # - Engagement rates
        # - Completion rates
        # - Student feedback
        # - Time on task

    def flag_problematic_content():
        """Identify content needing review"""

    def generate_quality_report():
        """Weekly quality summary"""
```

**Render Cron Jobs Configuration:**

Use Render's native cron job support (no Redis needed initially):

```yaml
# render.yaml (or configure in dashboard)
jobs:
  - type: cron
    name: daily-content-generation
    env: docker
    schedule: "0 6 * * *"  # 6 AM daily
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: python -m backend.jobs.scheduler generate_morning_content

  - type: cron
    name: weekly-badge-generation
    env: docker
    schedule: "0 2 * * 3"  # Wednesday 2 AM
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: python -m backend.jobs.scheduler create_new_badges

  - type: cron
    name: nightly-quality-audit
    env: docker
    schedule: "0 22 * * *"  # 10 PM daily
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: python -m backend.jobs.scheduler quality_audit
```

**AI Generation Workflow:**
```
1. Trigger (scheduled/manual) →
2. Analyze needs (content gaps, user requests) →
3. Generate content (Gemini API) →
4. Quality validation (automated scoring) →
5. Store in ai_generated_quests/badges →
6. Admin review (if score 0.60-0.85) →
7. Auto-publish (if score >0.85) →
8. Monitor performance →
9. Improve underperforming →
10. Retire low-engagement content
```

**Quality Gates:**
- Quality Score >0.85: Auto-publish
- Quality Score 0.60-0.85: Admin review required
- Quality Score <0.60: Reject, regenerate
- Monitor 7-day engagement after publish
- Flag for review if engagement <40%

## Implementation Details

### Credit Mapping System

**How It Works:**
- Each task has `credit_value` JSONB field: `{"math": 0.1, "science": 0.15, "english": 0.05}`
- Credits accumulate as students complete tasks
- 1 credit = approximately 25 hours of learning
- Standard quest = 0.2-0.5 credits distributed across subjects
- Diploma requires ~20 credits total (500 hours)

NOTES: tasks earn XP, not credit. XP is mapped to credit at the ratio of 1000 XP per credit. tasks provide XP toward pre-determined subject areas.

**Credit Calculation (XP-Based):**
```python
# When task completed:
task_xp_distribution = task.subject_xp_distribution  # {"math": 100, "science": 150, "english": 50}
total_xp = sum(task_xp_distribution.values())  # 300 XP

# Award XP per subject (existing system)
for subject, xp_amount in task_xp_distribution.items():
    award_subject_xp(user_id, subject, xp_amount)

    # Calculate and store credits: 1000 XP = 1 credit
    credits_earned = xp_amount / 1000.0  # 100 XP = 0.10 credits

    create_credit_entry(
        user_id=user_id,
        task_id=task_id,
        credit_type=subject,
        credits_earned=credits_earned,  # Derived from XP
        xp_amount=xp_amount,  # Store source XP for audit
        academic_year=current_year
    )
```

**Diploma Requirements:**
```python
DIPLOMA_REQUIREMENTS = {
    "math": 4.0,
    "science": 4.0,
    "english": 4.0,
    "history": 3.0,
    "foreign_language": 2.0,
    "arts": 1.0,
    "electives": 2.0,
    # Total: 20 credits
}
```

**Transcript Format:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "...",
  "total_credits": 12.5,
  "credits_by_subject": {
    "math": 2.5,
    "science": 3.0,
    "english": 2.0,
    "history": 2.5,
    "arts": 1.0,
    "electives": 1.5
  },
  "credits_by_year": {
    "2024": 6.0,
    "2025": 6.5
  },
  "diploma_progress": 0.625,  // 62.5% complete
  "estimated_completion": "2026-06"
}
```

### Badge-Quest Relationship Architecture

**Flexible Association Model:**
```python
# A quest can belong to multiple badges
quest.applicable_badges = [badge_id_1, badge_id_2, badge_id_3]

# A badge requires/suggests multiple quests
badge_quests = [
    {"quest_id": "...", "is_required": True, "order_index": 1},
    {"quest_id": "...", "is_required": True, "order_index": 2},
    {"quest_id": "...", "is_required": False, "order_index": 3},
    # 10-15 total quests per badge
]
```

**Badge Completion Requirements:**
- Must complete X required quests (typically 5-8)
- Must earn Y total XP (typically 1500-3000)
- May need to complete specific portfolio piece

**Quest Selection Freedom:**
- Students choose quest order within badge
- Can work on multiple badges simultaneously
- Same quest can count toward multiple badges
- Encourages exploration and flexibility

**Progress Calculation:**
```python
def calculate_badge_progress(user_id, badge_id):
    badge = get_badge(badge_id)
    required_quests = get_required_quests(badge_id)
    optional_quests = get_optional_quests(badge_id)

    completed_required = count_completed(user_id, required_quests)
    completed_optional = count_completed(user_id, optional_quests)

    xp_earned = sum_xp_for_badge(user_id, badge_id)

    quest_progress = completed_required / len(required_quests)
    xp_progress = xp_earned / badge.min_xp

    overall_progress = (quest_progress + xp_progress) / 2

    return {
        "percentage": overall_progress * 100,
        "quests_completed": completed_required,
        "quests_required": len(required_quests),
        "xp_earned": xp_earned,
        "xp_required": badge.min_xp,
        "is_complete": (quest_progress >= 1.0 and xp_progress >= 1.0)
    }
```

### AI Content Quality Gates

**Three-Tier Quality System:**

**Tier 1: Auto-Publish (Score >0.85)**
- High quality, ready for students
- Minimal human review needed
- Goes live immediately
- Monitored for 7 days
- Can be flagged by users

**Tier 2: Review Required (Score 0.60-0.85)**
- Decent quality, needs human polish
- Sent to admin review queue
- Admin can edit and approve
- Feedback loop improves AI
- Typically 20-30% of generations

**Tier 3: Reject (Score <0.60)**
- Low quality, needs regeneration
- Logged for prompt improvement
- Different parameters tried
- Not shown to students
- Analyzed for patterns

**Quality Dimensions:**
```python
quality_score = weighted_average([
    clarity * 0.25,          # Is it clear what to do?
    engagement * 0.20,       # Will students find it interesting?
    pedagogy * 0.25,         # Does it teach effectively?
    age_appropriate * 0.15,  # Suitable for 13-18?
    philosophy_aligned * 0.10, # Matches core values?
    diploma_relevant * 0.05  # Connects to academics?
])
```

**Post-Publication Monitoring:**
```python
# Track for 7 days after publishing
metrics = {
    "views": 0,
    "starts": 0,
    "completions": 0,
    "completion_rate": 0.0,
    "avg_rating": 0.0,
    "flags": 0
}

# Red flags:
if completion_rate < 0.30:  # <30% finish
    flag_for_review("Low completion rate")

if avg_rating < 2.5:  # Poor ratings
    flag_for_review("Low student satisfaction")

if flags > 3:  # Students flagging issues
    flag_for_review("Student concerns")
```

**Continuous Improvement Loop:**
```
1. Generate content →
2. Quality check →
3. Publish →
4. Monitor engagement →
5. Collect feedback →
6. Analyze patterns →
7. Refine prompts →
8. Regenerate improved version
```

### Core Philosophy Integration

**Badge Language Examples:**

✅ **Good Badge Identity Statements:**
- "I am becoming a systems thinker who sees connections"
- "I can express ideas through multiple creative mediums"
- "I have developed skills in scientific investigation"

❌ **Avoid:**
- "I am prepared for a STEM career"
- "I have proven my abilities to employers"
- "I am ahead of my peers"

**Quest Description Language:**

✅ **Process-Focused:**
- "Explore what happens when..."
- "Create something that shows your understanding of..."
- "Discover connections between..."
- "Build your skills by..."

❌ **Outcome-Focused:**
- "Master the concept of..."
- "Prove your knowledge of..."
- "Complete to show competence..."
- "Prepare yourself for..."

**Badge Completion Celebrations:**
```javascript
// When badge earned:
celebration_message = `
Amazing! You've become a ${badge.identity_statement}!

Take a moment to appreciate your growth. You've:
- Completed ${quests_done} learning adventures
- Gained ${xp_earned} XP exploring ${badge.pillar_primary}
- Created ${evidence_count} pieces showcasing your journey

You're becoming more yourself through this learning.
What badge will you explore next?
`
```

**Diploma Page Messaging:**
```
Header: "Your Learning Story"
Subtext: "A celebration of your growth and creations"

Badge Section Header: "Identities I'm Developing"
Quest Evidence Header: "Adventures I've Explored"
Skills Section Header: "Areas I'm Growing In"

NO mentions of: careers, employers, college admissions, standing out, being impressive
FOCUS on: growth, discovery, capability, confidence, creation
```

## Notes & Questions

### Key Adjustments Based on User Feedback:

1. **Terminology**: Use "complexity level" instead of "difficulty level" throughout
2. **XP to Credit Mapping**: Tasks earn XP, not credits directly. 1000 XP = 1 accredited high school credit
3. **Quest Personalization Model**: "Learn Algebra" quest with AI-suggested tasks based on interests OR traditional curriculum (Khan Academy)
4. **Task Structure**: Students see AI-generated task options they can accept/modify, not prescriptive requirements
5. **ADDITIVE FEATURE**: Badge system is NEW, existing Quest Hub remains fully functional as-is
6. **Quest Pivoting**: Students can edit/add/delete tasks from in-progress quests via "Pivot" button

### UX Recommendations & Design Decisions

#### 1. Badge Selection Flow (First-Time Users)

**Recommended Approach: Guided Discovery**
```
New User Onboarding:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ "What sparks your curiosity?"               │
│                                             │
│ [Show 6-8 badge cards with identity        │
│  statements and preview images]             │
│                                             │
│ Filter by:                                  │
│ □ Building things   □ Creative expression  │
│ □ Understanding    □ Helping others        │
│ □ Solving problems □ Exploring ideas       │
│                                             │
│ [Browse All Badges] [Let AI Suggest]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Works:**
- Avoids quiz fatigue (no 20 questions)
- Presents tangible options immediately
- Interest filters feel exploratory, not limiting
- "Let AI Suggest" for students who want guidance
- Can skip and browse (no forcing)

#### 2. Dual Navigation Structure

**Recommended: Progressive Disclosure**

**Dashboard Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Your Active Badges (1-3 shown)              │
│ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐                  │
│ │ Badge 1  │ │ Badge 2  │                  │
│ │ 60% done │ │ 15% done │                  │
│ └──────────┘ └──────────┘                  │
│                                             │
│ Continue Your Journey                       │
│ → Next recommended quest for [Badge]        │
│                                             │
│ Or explore freely:                          │
│ [Quest Hub] [Badge Library] [Custom Quest] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Navigation Tabs:**
```
[Dashboard] [Quests] [Badges] [My Progress]
```

**Key Insight**: Badge system is ADDITIVE to existing Quest Hub

**Three Ways to Use Optio:**
1. **Badge-Driven Path** (NEW - structured learning)
   - Select badge → see required quests → complete for badge
2. **Quest Hub** (EXISTING - continues as-is)
   - Browse all quests by pillar/subject
   - Start any quest independently
   - No badge required
3. **Custom Quest Creation** (ENHANCED with AI)
   - Student-initiated
   - AI generates task options
   - Fully customizable

**All three coexist** - students choose their approach

#### 3. AI Quest Generation UX Enhancements

**Enhanced Flow Based on User Example:**

**Step 1: Quest Type Selection**
```
What do you want to explore?

[Create Something]    [Learn from Course]
[Improve Something]   [Custom Idea]

Each option shows 2-3 example badges it counts toward
```

**Step 2: Smart Customization**
```
Quest: "Learn Algebra"

AI: "I can personalize this for you. How do you learn best?"

○ Follow traditional curriculum (Khan Academy, structured)
○ Apply to my interests (What interests you?)
  └─ [Game design] [Music] [Sports] [Art] [Other: _____]
○ Mix of both
○ Surprise me with creative approaches

[Generate Quest]
```

**Step 3: Task Options (NEW: Choice-Based)**
```
Your Personalized Quest: Master Algebra Through Music

Here are suggested tasks. Select the ones that resonate:

☑ Analyze song structures using algebraic patterns (100 XP)
  → 0.10 Mathematics
  Resources: [Music theory] [Pattern guide]

☑ Create chord progressions with equations (80 XP)
  → 0.06 Mathematics, 0.02 Fine Arts
  Resources: [Chord calculator] [Examples]

□ Follow Khan Academy: Linear Equations (120 XP)

  → 0.07 Mathematics, 0.02 Language Arts
  Resources: [Teaching guide]

Selected: 430 XP | Est. time: 2-3 weeks

[Adjust Selection] [Add More Tasks] [Start Quest]
```

**Why This Is Better:**
- Student agency (choose tasks that resonate)
- Mix-and-match traditional + creative
- Can add/remove tasks before starting
- Transparent about XP and credits
- "Learn Algebra" quest works for everyone

**Step 4: Quest Pivoting (In-Progress Editing)**
```

│ [Save Changes] [Cancel]                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pivot Rules:**
- Can remove uncompleted tasks anytime
- Can add new tasks (AI-suggested or custom)
- Completed tasks locked (XP already awarded)
- Total XP/credits recalculated
- Quest remains active, progress preserved
- Badge progress updated if applicable

**Why Pivoting Matters:**
- Student realizes current approach isn't working
- Interest shifts mid-quest
- Finds better resources/methods
- Wants more challenge or easier path
- Learning is adaptive, not fixed

#### 4. Constellation Visualization

**Age-Appropriate Design:**

**For 12-14 year olds:**
- Playful, colorful constellation
- Stars pulse when hovered
- Satisfying connection animations
- Badge shape clearly recognizable

**For 15-18 year olds:**
- Minimalist, elegant design
- Subtle gradients (Optio pink-purple)
- Data-viz aesthetic (not cartoonish)
- Toggle to "network graph" view
- Export as image for portfolio

**Common Elements:**
- Click star → view quest evidence
- Progress indicator (X/Y stars lit)
- Smooth animations, not bouncy
- Dark mode option

**Alternative View Toggle:**
```
[Constellation] [List View] [Timeline]
```

#### 5. Credit Transparency Strategy

**Recommended: Contextual Visibility**

**Show Credits:**
- On task cards: "80 XP → 0.08 Mathematics"
- On quest summary: "Total: 480 XP (0.48 credits)"
- On transcript page: Full breakdown
- In diploma view: Credit totals prominent

**Hide Calculation:**
- Don't show "1000 XP = 1 credit" everywhere
- Make it visible in "Info" tooltip
- Education section: "How Credits Work"

**Language:**
```
✅ "You've earned 0.5 credits in Mathematics"
✅ "This quest contributes 0.3 credits toward your diploma"
❌ "Complete 1000 XP to get 1 credit"
❌ "You need 20 credits to graduate"
```

**Why:** Frame credits as accumulation of learning, not arbitrary targets

#### 6. Badge Completion Celebration

**Multi-Modal Celebration:**

**Visual:**
- Full-screen badge reveal animation
- Constellation completes its pattern
- Confetti (tasteful, not childish)
- Badge glows in diploma page

**Textual:**
```
Amazing! You've become a Creative Storyteller!

Your Growth:
→ 8 quests explored
→ 2,400 XP earned in Language & Communication
→ 12 pieces of evidence created

This badge represents who you're becoming.
What will you explore next?

[View Your Diploma] [Choose Next Badge] [Share]
```

**Social:**
- Option to share (not required)
- Shows on friends' feeds if enabled
- Advisor gets notification

**Tangible:**
- Add to diploma page immediately
- Unlock new quest options
- Milestone in transcript

#### 7. Dashboard Priority & Layout

**Information Hierarchy (Top → Bottom):**

1. **Active Badge Progress** (Primary focus)
   - 1-3 active badges with progress bars
   - Next recommended quest CTA

2. **Quick Continue** (Immediate action)
   - Resume in-progress quest
   - OR start recommended next quest

3. **Learning Stats** (Motivational)
   - Total XP gained (this week)
   - Credits earned toward diploma

   - New quests in your interests

5. **Advisor Notes** (If applicable)
   - Gentle suggestions, not assignments
   - "Your advisor recommended: [Badge]"

**Mobile-First Considerations:**
- Cards stack vertically
- Swipe between active badges
- Collapsible sections
- Bottom nav: [Dashboard] [Quests] [Progress] [More]

#### 8. Mobile Experience Design

**Quest Browsing (Mobile):**
```
[Filter ▼] [Search 🔍]

╔════════════════════════╗
║ Quest Card             ║
║ [Image]                ║

❌ "Your advisor assigned: [Quest]"
❌ "Required by advisor"
```

**Visual Treatment:**
- Soft highlight (not alarm red)
- "Suggested" badge, not "Assigned"
- Can dismiss recommendation
- Clear it's optional

**Notification Style:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ 💡 New suggestion from Mr. Lee │
│                                │
│ "I noticed your interest in    │
│  game design. Check out the    │

### Potential UX Pitfalls & Solutions

#### Pitfall 1: Badge Lock-In Feeling
**Problem:** Students feel stuck with chosen badge, can't explore freely
**Solution:**
- Allow multiple active badges (2-3)
- "Pause badge" option (not abandon)
- Quest Hub always accessible
- Clear messaging: "Badges guide you, but you're always free to explore"

#### Pitfall 2: AI Task Acceptance Friction
**Problem:** Students don't realize they can modify AI-generated tasks
**Solution:**
- "[Adjust with AI]" button prominent
- Tooltip: "Don't like a task? Click to change it"
- Show 1-2 alternative task options inline
- Tutorial highlights customization

#### Pitfall 3: Credit Math Confusion
**Problem:** "Why did I get 0.08 credits for this task?"
**Solution:**
- Tooltip on credit values: "Credits reflect learning time. This task = ~2 hours of learning"
- Info page: "How Credits Work"
- Focus messaging on XP, credits secondary
- Visual: XP bar fills, credits accumulate in background

#### Pitfall 4: Complexity Discouragement
**Problem:** "Advanced" label deters students from trying
**Solution:**
- Remove labels, use descriptions instead
- "This quest involves 6 multi-part tasks over 3 weeks"
- Emphasize growth: "Challenge yourself!" not "This is hard"
- Show success stories: "Emma started as beginner, now creating..."

#### Pitfall 5: Advisor Recommendations Feel Like Homework
**Problem:** Students ignore or resent advisor suggestions
**Solution:**
- Soft visual treatment (not red alert)
- Personal note from advisor shows
- Students can dismiss without guilt
- "Suggested" never "Required"
- Badges appear in regular browse with "Suggested for you" tag

#### Pitfall 6: Constellation Feels Childish to Older Students
**Problem:** 16-18 year olds find star visualization immature
**Solution:**
- Age-adaptive design
- Alternative views: network graph, timeline, list
- Export options for portfolios
- Minimalist aesthetic option
- Let students customize visualization

#### Pitfall 7: Too Many Active Badges
**Problem:** Students start 5 badges, complete none
**Solution:**
- Limit active badges to 3
- Warning: "You have 3 active badges. Pause one to start another?"
- Dashboard surfaces oldest incomplete badge
- Gentle nudge: "You're close! 85% done with Systems Thinker"

#### Pitfall 8: Mobile Evidence Upload Friction
**Problem:** Students abandon tasks because upload is clunky
**Solution:**
- One-tap camera access
- Voice memos as evidence
- Auto-save drafts
- Upload later option
- Progress saved even without evidence

---

### A/B Test Suggestions

#### Test 1: Badge Selection Flow
**Variant A:** Quiz-based recommendation
**Variant B:** Visual browse with filters
**Metric:** Badge selection rate, time to first quest start

#### Test 2: Dashboard Priority
**Variant A:** Active badges shown first
**Variant B:** Recommended next quest shown first
**Metric:** Quest start rate, daily active usage

#### Test 3: Credit Visibility
**Variant A:** Credits shown on every task
**Variant B:** Credits shown only in transcript/diploma
**Metric:** User comprehension survey, engagement rates

#### Test 4: AI Quest Customization
**Variant A:** Auto-generate, allow edits after
**Variant B:** Show task options, student selects
**Metric:** Quest start rate, task completion rate, customization usage

#### Test 5: Complexity Labeling
**Variant A:** "Foundational/Developing/Advanced"
**Variant B:** Time estimates only
**Metric:** Quest distribution, completion rates by label

#### Test 6: Constellation vs. List View (Default)
**Variant A:** Constellation as default progress view
**Variant B:** List view as default, constellation optional
**Metric:** View frequency, user preference surveys
