## System Design Notes

**Core Data Structures:**
- The Badge system is an abstraction layer built upon the existing Quest architecture.
- The fundamental structure of a `Quest` (defined in `quests`) composed of multiple `Tasks` (defined in `quest_tasks`) is preserved.
- Badge completion logic (e.g., "complete any 5 of 10 quests") is handled in the `badge_service` and does not alter the individual quest completion workflow.

**Frontend Navigation Strategy:**
- The `ProfilePage` acts as the central navigation hub.
- `BadgeExplorer.jsx` (`/badges`) is the primary entry point for discovering long-term learning goals and structured paths (Badges).
- `QuestHub.jsx` (`/quests`) coexists and serves as a library for finding individual, standalone activities that may not be part of a badge.

**AI Badge-Quest Linking:**
- **Analysis Criteria**:
  - Pillar Alignment (0-100%): How well quest pillars match badge primary pillar
  - Skill Development Match (0-100%): Quest skills vs badge identity statement
  - XP Appropriateness (0-100%): Quest XP value vs badge XP requirement
  - Overall Confidence (0-100%): Weighted recommendation score
  - AI Reasoning: One sentence explanation for recommendation
- **Confidence Levels**:
  - High (85%+): Strong alignment, highly recommended
  - Medium (70-85%): Good fit, recommended with caveats
  - Low (<70%): Weak alignment, manual review suggested
- **Automation Features**:
  - Single badge analysis: Get recommendations for one badge
  - Bulk analysis: Analyze all 13 badges simultaneously
  - Preview mode: See recommendations before applying
  - One-click auto-link: Apply all recommendations at once
  - Batch operations: ~10-15 quests per badge in 30 seconds

**Badge Completion Model:**
- Flexible: Complete ANY min_quests number of linked quests
- No specific quests "required"
- Retroactive counting of previously completed quests
- "Complete any X of these quests" messaging
- Student-driven learning paths

**Navigation Hub:**
- ProfilePage serves as central hub
- 8 feature links: Badge Explorer, Badge Progress, Constellation, Credit Tracker, Transcript, Diploma, Dashboard, Quest Hub
- Full-width horizontal stacking for better UX

**Key Routes:**
- `/badges` - Badge explorer
- `/badges/:badgeId` - Badge detail
- `/constellation` - Star map visualization
- `/badge-progress` - Progress dashboard
- `/credits` - Credit tracking
- `/transcript` - Academic transcript
- `/diploma` - Portfolio with earned badges
- `/profile` - Central navigation hub
