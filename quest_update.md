## System Design Notes

**Badge Completion Model:**
- Flexible: Complete ANY min_quests number of linked quests
- No specific quests "required"
- Retroactive counting of previously completed quests
- "Complete any X of these quests" messaging
- Student-driven learning paths

**Navigation Hub:**
- ProfilePage serves as central hub
- 8 feature links: Badge Explorer, Badge Progress, Constellation, Credit Tracker, Transcript, Diploma, Dashboard, Quest Hub
- Full-width horizontal stacking for better UX

**Key Routes:**
- `/badges` - Badge explorer
- `/badges/:badgeId` - Badge detail
- `/constellation` - Star map visualization
- `/badge-progress` - Progress dashboard
- `/credits` - Credit tracking
- `/transcript` - Academic transcript
- `/diploma` - Portfolio with earned badges
- `/profile` - Central navigation hub
