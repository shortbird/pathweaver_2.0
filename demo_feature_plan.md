# Optio Platform Demo Feature - Implementation Plan & To-Do List

## Executive Summary
The demo feature will be an interactive, 2-3 minute experience on the Optio homepage that helps potential users (primarily parents of disengaged students and homeschoolers) quickly understand the unique value of self-validated diplomas through quest-based learning. The demo will simulate the core user experience: selecting quests, completing tasks, earning XP, and generating a shareable diploma. For parents interested in more structure, the demo will highlight the Visionary tier's accredited high school diploma option with teacher support, offering the best of both traditional and innovative education.
