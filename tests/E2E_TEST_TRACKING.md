## Phase 1: Critical Authentication & Core Flows (IN PROGRESS)

### 🟡 auth.spec.js (5/6 passing, 1 failing)
- [x] Display login page ✅
- [ ] Login with valid credentials ❌ (strict mode: "Welcome back" in both login + dashboard)
- [x] Show error for invalid credentials ✅
- [x] Logout successfully ✅
- [x] Redirect unauthenticated users from protected routes ✅
- [x] Persist session across page refreshes (httpOnly cookies) ✅
- [ ] Password strength validation on registration (not implemented)
- [ ] Email verification flow (not implemented)

**Status**: Mostly fixed (5/6 passing)
**Issue**: Need to fix "Welcome back" selector to be more specific (dashboard vs login page)

### 🟡 quest-enrollment.spec.js (1/6 passing, 5 failing)
- [x] Display available quests ✅
- [ ] View quest details ❌ (login helper redirect timeout)
- [ ] Enroll in a quest (pick up) ❌ (selector timeout - `.quest-card` doesn't exist)
- [ ] Show enrolled quests in My Quests ❌ (`.active-quest` selector doesn't exist)
- [ ] Complete quest personalization ❌ (selector timeout)
- [ ] Drop a quest (set down) ❌ (selector timeout)

**Status**: Needs complete rebuild with actual selectors
**Issues**:
- Login helper inconsistent (some tests timeout on redirect)
- All selectors are wrong (`.quest-card`, `.active-quest` don't exist)
- Tests assume test account has active quests (needs setup data or better logic)

### 🔴 task-completion.spec.js (0/7 failing)
- [ ] Display quest tasks ❌ (selector timeout - `.active-quest` doesn't exist)
- [ ] Open task evidence submission form ❌ (selector timeout)
- [ ] Submit text evidence ❌ (selector timeout)
- [ ] Submit link evidence ❌ (selector timeout)
- [ ] Show task completion progress ❌ (login helper redirect timeout)
- [ ] Show XP earned ❌ (element not found - XP display selectors wrong)
- [ ] View completed tasks ❌ (login helper redirect timeout)

**Status**: All tests failing - complete rebuild needed
**Issues**:
- Login helper completely broken in this file
- All selectors wrong (assumes test account has active quests with tasks)
- No test data setup (can't test task completion without enrolled quest)

### 🟡 badge-claiming.spec.js (3/7 passing, 4 failing)
- [x] Display available badges ✅
- [ ] View badge details ❌ (selector timeout - `.badge-card` doesn't exist)
- [ ] Show badge progress ❌ (element not found - progress UI selectors wrong)
- [x] Claim completed badge if available ✅ (test skipped - no claimable badges)
- [ ] View diploma with claimed badges ❌ (strict mode - multiple "diploma" matches)
- [ ] Show XP by pillar ❌ (element not found - XP breakdown selectors wrong)
- [x] Filter badges by pillar ✅

**Status**: Partial success (3/7 passing) - needs selector fixes
**Issues**:
- Badge card selectors don't match actual UI
- Progress/XP display selectors incorrect
- Diploma page has strict mode violation (too many matches)

### ❌ portfolio.spec.js (0/6 tests) - CORE FEATURE

  - auth.spec.js: 5/6 ✅ (83%)
  - quest-enrollment.spec.js: 1/6 ❌ (17%)

  - badge-claiming.spec.js: 3/7 ✅ (43%)
- **Phase 2 (Profile/Social)**: 0/18 tests (0%) - ❌ Not started
- **Phase 3 (Parent/Observer)**: 0/21 tests (0%) - ❌ Not started

### Key Findings (Dec 19, 2025 Test Run):

- **Selectors all wrong**: Generic selectors like `.quest-card`, `.badge-card` don't exist
- **Strict mode violations**: Multiple "Welcome back" and "diploma" text matches

## Notes

- **No retries**: Set to 0 in playwright.config.js for faster debugging
- **Test isolation**: Each test should be independent (no shared state)
- **Real selectors**: All tests use actual UI elements from the codebase
- **Comments**: Reference actual file locations for maintainability
- **Test account**: test@optioeducation.com (student role, Optio organization)
