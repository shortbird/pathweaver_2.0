# Parent Dashboard Implementation Progress

## Overview

The Parent Dashboard is a comprehensive feature allowing parents to monitor their children's learning progress with a process-focused, philosophy-aligned approach. This document tracks implementation progress and remaining work.

## Core Philosophy Alignment

**"The Process Is The Goal"**
- Learning rhythm indicator (green = flow state, yellow = may need support)
- No "achievement" or "performance" language
- Present-focused: "is exploring", "currently learning"
- Process celebration over outcome focus
- Conversation starters instead of directives

## Project Status: Backend Complete, Frontend In Progress

### âœ… Completed (2025-01-17)

#### Database Schema
- **Migration File**: `backend/migrations/add_parent_dashboard_schema.sql`
- **Status**: âœ… Executed on Supabase production database
- **Tables Created**:
  - `parent_student_links` - Active connections (pending_invitation, pending_approval, active)

    """Student cancels a pending invitation"""
    pass

@bp.route('/my-links', methods=['GET'])
@require_auth
def get_my_parent_links(user_id):
    """Student views approved parent connections"""
    pass

POST /api/parent/evidence/:evidence_id/approve
Body: {}

// Reject evidence
POST /api/parent/evidence/:evidence_id/reject
Body: {}
```

### 5. Parent Dashboard Tab Improvements

**Current State**: Basic tab structure exists but needs full implementation

**Overview Tab** - Needs:
- [ ] Weekly wins formatting (if flow state)
- [ ] Conversation starters formatting (if needs support)
- [ ] Active quests grid layout with images
- [ ] Better loading states

**Calendar Tab** - Needs:
- [ ] Full calendar view (not just list)
- [ ] Color-coding by pillar
- [ ] Task completion status indicators
- [ ] Filtering options

**Insights Tab** - Needs:
- [ ] XP by pillar radar chart (Chart.js or Recharts)
- [ ] Time patterns visualization
- [ ] Pillar preferences bar chart
- [ ] Completion velocity trend line

**Communications Tab** - Needs:
- [ ] Tutor conversation list with safety indicators
- [ ] Expandable conversation view
- [ ] Safety monitoring badges
- [ ] Filter by conversation mode

### 6. Navigation & Access

**Missing**: Navigation links to parent dashboard

**Required Changes**:
- Add "Parent Dashboard" link to navigation bar (only for parent role)
- Update `frontend/src/components/Navigation.jsx` or equivalent
- Add role-based visibility logic

### 7. Testing & Validation

**Manual Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Student can send parent invitation
- [ ] Parent receives invitation email with working link
- [ ] Parent can register from invitation token
- [ ] Student receives approval request notification
- [ ] Student can approve/reject parent connection
- [ ] Parent can view dashboard after approval
- [ ] Learning rhythm indicator works correctly (green/yellow logic)
- [ ] Multi-child selector works (if parent has multiple students)
- [ ] Parent can upload evidence
- [ ] Student receives evidence approval request
- [ ] Student can approve/reject evidence
- [ ] Evidence approval creates task completion and awards XP
- [ ] All tabs load data correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] CSRF protection works on all POST endpoints
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized access

**Automated Testing**:
- [ ] Unit tests for backend API endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests for invitation workflow
- [ ] E2E tests for complete parent-student flow

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Path (Blocking)
1. **Student Invitation UI** - Without this, parents can't be invited
2. **Student Approval UI** - Without this, connections can't be activated
3. **Backend endpoints for invitation/approval listing**

### Phase 2: Core Features
4. **Parent Evidence Upload UI**
5. **Student Evidence Approval UI**
6. **Navigation links**

### Phase 3: Enhancements
7. **Dashboard tab improvements** (charts, visualizations)
8. **Notification system** for pending approvals/evidence
9. **Testing & validation**

---

## Key Design Decisions

### No Revocation
- Once a parent-student link is approved, it's **permanent**
- No UI or API for revoking access
- Database schema has NO 'revoked' status
- Design decision per user requirements

### Student Consent Required
- Two-step approval process:
  1. Parent accepts invitation and registers
  2. Student must approve before link becomes active
- Students have final say over parent access

### Parents Cannot Start Quests
- Parents can ONLY upload evidence for existing active tasks
- Students must start quests themselves
- Design maintains student autonomy

### Evidence Approval
- All parent-uploaded evidence requires student approval
- Creates task completion and awards XP only after approval
- Students can reject evidence without penalty

### Learning Rhythm Algorithm
```sql
Flow State = (No overdue tasks) AND (Recent progress in last 7 days)
Needs Support = Otherwise

Recent Progress = Task completion OR Quest start in last 7 days
Overdue Tasks = Scheduled tasks past due date with no completion
```

---

## Technical Notes

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables needed - uses existing Supabase and email configuration.

### Database Schema
All tables, functions, and RLS policies are in place. No additional migrations required.

### CSRF Protection
All state-changing endpoints require:
- `Content-Type: application/json` header
- `X-CSRF-Token` header with valid token
- JSON body (even if empty `{}`)

### File Uploads
Evidence uploads use existing file upload system:
- `backend/routes/uploads.py` for file handling
- Supabase storage for file hosting
- Returns `file_url` for evidence record

---

## Questions & Considerations

### Email Delivery
- [ ] Test invitation emails in production
- [ ] Verify email template renders correctly in all email clients
- [ ] Check spam folder filtering
- [ ] Consider email rate limiting for invitation sends

### Performance
- [ ] Dashboard data loading performance with multiple children
- [ ] Caching strategy for frequently accessed data (learning rhythm, insights)
- [ ] Lazy loading for calendar/communications tabs

### Security
- [ ] Verify RLS policies prevent data leaks
- [ ] Test token expiry enforcement (48 hours)
- [ ] Validate all parent-student access checks
- [ ] Audit log for parent evidence submissions

### User Experience
- [ ] What happens if invitation email is not received?
- [ ] Can students resend invitations?
- [ ] How are parents notified of new evidence approval requests?
- [ ] Should there be a parent mobile app consideration?

   - Implement rejection endpoint

3. **Test end-to-end workflow**
   - Create test student account
   - Send invitation to test parent email
   - Complete registration and approval flow
   - Verify dashboard access

4. **Implement evidence upload/approval**
   - Build evidence upload UI for parents
   - Build evidence review UI for students
   - Test complete evidence workflow

5. **Polish dashboard tabs**
