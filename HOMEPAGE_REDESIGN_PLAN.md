## Risk Mitigation

### Phase 1 Risks:
- **Risk**: Over-promising with mockups
- **Mitigation**: Clear "Example" labels on all placeholder content

- **Risk**: Breaking existing user flows
- **Mitigation**: Maintain all current navigation paths

### Phase 2 Risks:
- **Risk**: Insufficient data for social proof
- **Mitigation**: Start collecting testimonials early, use quality over quantity

- **Risk**: Privacy concerns with student showcases
- **Mitigation**: Explicit opt-in for featured portfolios, anonymization options

## Notes for Development

1. **Design Tokens**: Establish consistent spacing, typography, and color variables
2. **Component Reusability**: Build modular components for Phase 2 integration
3. **Performance**: Lazy load images and non-critical content
4. **SEO**: Ensure all content is crawlable and meta tags are optimized
5. **Analytics**: Add event tracking to all interactive elements

## Conclusion

This phased approach allows us to immediately improve the homepage experience while building infrastructure for data-driven enhancements. Phase 1 creates a professional, compelling homepage that clearly communicates Optio's value proposition, while Phase 2 will add authenticity and social proof once we have real student success stories to share.
