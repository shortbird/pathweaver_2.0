## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL FIXES (Priority 1 - Production Bugs)

### Fix 1: Quest Completion Error - Missing Column `xp_awarded`

**Status**: CRITICAL - Prevents quest completion flow
**Error**: `column user_quest_tasks.xp_awarded does not exist`
**Location**: `/api/quests/{quest_id}/end` endpoint

#### Root Cause Analysis
- Backend is trying to query/update a column `xp_awarded` in `user_quest_tasks` table
- This column doesn't exist in the current schema
- Quest IS completing (status shows deactivated on refresh), but returns 500 error
- Frontend doesn't refresh automatically due to error response

#### Implementation Tasks
- [x] **Database Investigation**
  - [x] Use Supabase MCP to verify current schema: `mcp__supabase__list_tables`
  - [x] Check `user_quest_tasks` table structure - confirmed `xp_value` column exists
  - [x] Check `quest_task_completions` table - no `xp_awarded` column
  - [x] Identified query at line 853 incorrectly using `xp_awarded`

- [x] **Backend Fix** - [routes/quests.py:853](routes/quests.py#L853)
  - [x] Located the `end_quest` function around line 850
  - [x] Found the `.select('xp_awarded')` call on line 853
  - [x] Changed from `xp_awarded` to `xp_value` (correct column name)
  - [x] Also fixed line 857 to use `xp_value` instead of `xp_awarded`

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Test quest completion flow end-to-end
  - [ ] Verify XP is still awarded correctly
  - [ ] Confirm frontend auto-refreshes after completion
  - [ ] Check that completed quest shows properly in dashboard

#### Files to Check
- `backend/routes/quests.py` (line ~855)
- Database schema for `user_quest_tasks` table
- Database schema for `quest_task_completions` table

### Fix 6: Unable to Enroll in Quest - RLS Policy Violation

**Status**: CRITICAL - Blocks core user functionality
**Error**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "user_quests"`
**Location**: `/api/quests/{quest_id}/enroll` endpoint

#### Root Cause Analysis
- RLS policy on `user_quests` table is blocking INSERT operations
- Error occurs at line 238 in `quest_repository.py` (enroll_user function)
- User authentication may be passing incorrectly to Supabase client
- OR RLS policy is too restrictive

#### Implementation Tasks
- [x] **Database Investigation**
  - [x] Use Supabase MCP to check RLS policies on `user_quests` table
  - [x] Query: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'user_quests'`
  - [x] Verified policy allows INSERT when `auth.uid() = user_id` âœ“
  - [x] Policy is correct

- [x] **Backend Investigation** - [repositories/base_repository.py:82](repositories/base_repository.py#L82)
  - [x] Located `client` property in BaseRepository
  - [x] Found that `get_user_client()` was called without token parameter
  - [x] Issue: httpOnly cookies don't send Authorization header automatically
  - [x] JWT token must be explicitly extracted from cookies

- [x] **Backend Fix** - [repositories/base_repository.py:70-100](repositories/base_repository.py#L70-100)
  - [x] Updated BaseRepository.client property to extract token from cookies
  - [x] Now checks Authorization header first, then falls back to httpOnly cookie
  - [x] Passes token explicitly to `get_user_client(token=token)`
  - [x] This fix applies to ALL repositories using BaseRepository

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Test quest enrollment as student user
  - [ ] Test with multiple users simultaneously
  - [ ] Verify enrollment appears in user's active quests
  - [ ] Check error handling for already-enrolled cases

#### Files to Check
- `backend/repositories/quest_repository.py` (line ~238)
- `backend/routes/quests.py` (enroll_in_quest function, line ~473)
- Supabase RLS policies for `user_quests` table

## ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (Priority 2 - UX Issues)

### Fix 2: Evidence Modal Inconsistency

**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED - No inconsistency found
**Issue**: Completed tasks in completed quests use old evidence modal version
**Resolution**: Investigation revealed all evidence modals already use the newer, standardized versions. No action needed.

#### Investigation Results
- [x] **Frontend Investigation** - COMPLETE

  - [ ] Identify the NEWER/BETTER evidence modal version
  - [ ] Extract into reusable component if not already done
  - [ ] Update ALL task card components to use same modal
  - [ ] Ensure props interface is consistent

- [ ] **Component Updates**
  - [ ] Active quest task cards â†’ ensure using standard modal
  - [ ] Completed quest task cards â†’ update to use standard modal
  - [ ] Task completion page â†’ verify modal usage
  - [ ] Any other task evidence views â†’ standardize

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Test evidence viewing in active quests
  - [ ] Test evidence viewing in completed quests
  - [ ] Test evidence editing in both contexts
  - [ ] Verify modal appearance and functionality match exactly

#### Files to Check
- `frontend/src/components/` (task card components)
- `frontend/src/components/ui/` (modal components)
- `frontend/src/pages/QuestDetail.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/diploma/` (completed quest display)

  - [x] Located empty state message in DashboardPage component (line 27)
  - [x] Found message text in ActiveQuests component
  - [x] Component did not have access to completed quest count

- [x] **API Check** - [backend/routes/users/dashboard.py](backend/routes/users/dashboard.py#L73-81)
  - [x] Dashboard API did not return completed quest count
  - [x] Added query to count completed quests (is_active=False AND completed_at IS NOT NULL)
  - [x] Added `completed_quests_count` to stats object in dashboard response (line 103)

- [x] **Message Logic Update** - [pages/DashboardPage.jsx](pages/DashboardPage.jsx#L16-19)
  - [x] Added `completedQuestsCount` prop to ActiveQuests component
  - [x] If `completed_quests_count === 0`: "No quests yet." + "Start Your First Quest"
  - [x] If `completed_quests_count > 0`: "Ready for your next learning adventure?" + "Pick Up a New Quest"
  - [x] Language is process-focused and encouraging

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Test with brand new user (0 completed quests)
  - [ ] Test with user who has completed quests but no active ones
  - [ ] Test with user who has both active and completed quests
  - [ ] Verify message changes appropriately

#### Files to Check
- `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx`
- `backend/routes/users/dashboard.py`

### Fix 4: Calendar Task Persistence

**Status**: âœ… FIXED - Deployed to develop
**Issue**: Completed tasks disappear from calendar when quest is finished
**Resolution**: Modified [calendar.py:54-68](backend/routes/calendar.py#L54-68) to include tasks from completed quests

#### Implementation Tasks
- [x] **Calendar Component Investigation** - COMPLETE
  - [ ] Locate calendar component (likely in `components/` or `pages/`)
  - [ ] Find query that fetches tasks for calendar view
  - [ ] Identify filter that removes completed quest tasks

- [x] **Backend API Update** - COMPLETE
  - [x] Located calendar endpoint at `/api/calendar`
  - [x] Updated query to include ALL active quests (including completed ones)
  - [x] Only excludes abandoned quests (is_active=False)
  - [x] Completed tasks already included with status='completed'

- [x] **Frontend Display Update** - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
  - [x] Calendar already shows completed tasks with green status
  - [x] Styling already differentiates completed vs active tasks
  - [x] Status helper function in useCalendar.js handles color coding

- [ ] **Testing** - NEEDS VERIFICATION
  - [ ] Complete a quest with tasks on calendar
  - [ ] Verify completed tasks remain visible after quest completion
  - [ ] Check that date ranges work correctly
  - [ ] Test with multiple completed quests over time

  - [ ] Parents: Full read access + evidence upload
  - [ ] Observers: Read-only access, no evidence upload
  - [ ] Both: Can view AI tutor conversations for safety monitoring
  - [ ] Both: Can view calendar, insights, progress

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Send invitation as parent role
  - [ ] Send invitation as observer role
  - [ ] Accept both types and verify permission differences
  - [ ] Test evidence upload (should work for parent, not observer)
  - [ ] Verify dashboard displays appropriately for each role
