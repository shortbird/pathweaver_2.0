OPTIO
Supporting Parents. Empowering Students. Building Futures.

Current Mode Of Operations:
None of it is saved outside the OnFire platform which makes student work hard to track or showcase.
OnFire families can't prove what their kids actually learned.
Colleges see transcripts, not capability.

What We Built
Automatic portfolio generation
Submit once in Spark → Portfolio updates instantly
No uploads. No extra logins. No friction.

Why Now
Homeschool enrollment is up 18% since 2020, but students still struggle to adequately prove their previous success to colleges and employers. Colleges are moving away from test scores and demanding evidence of actual learning, meaning portfolios, work samples, and demonstrated skills. Merging OnFire and Optio allows families to take every opportunity to track results and deliver insights through organized reports, making students ready for college and beyond.

How It Works
Student completes essay in OnFire.
Optio receives it automatically via LTI.
Portfolio updates in real-time with verified work samples.
Parents, colleges, employers see actual output.

Phase 1: Launch Features
Auto-sync portfolios — The entire value prop
Public showcase pages — Custom URLs for every student
Single sign-on — Access through Spark, nothing new to learn
Quest system — Gamified progress tracking with XP. Optio’s real-world quests are a great way for students to apply their learning from OnFire courses to the real world.
Cross-course badges — Unlock achievements, discover new courses, drive additional OnFire course purchases.
Parent dashboard — Read-only view into student momentum
Observer roles — Extended family and mentors can cheer progress
AI tutor — 24/7 Gemini-powered learning support

Trackable, Data-Driven Success
Students gain a portfolio and proof that their work matters, parents are able to see proof their educational funds are working, while OnFire increases course completion and unlocks organic upsells through the badge system. By the end of any student’s tenure at Optio and OnFire, they can give colleges and employers real evidence of what they’ve done.

The Play Book
Badges drive cross-enrollment.
"Earn STEM Scholar? Take Physics next."
Family gifting unlocks new revenue stream.

Spark sells more courses. We grow together.
