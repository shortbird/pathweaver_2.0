# AI Quest Generation Tool - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for creating an AI-powered quest generation system that can create hundreds or thousands of high-quality educational quests for Optio Quests.

## Goals
1. Generate diverse, educational quests across all 6 skill categories
2. Ensure quests are age-appropriate and engaging for high school students
3. Maintain consistent quality and format with existing quests
4. Include proper XP awards, difficulty levels, and validation criteria
5. Support bulk generation and review workflows

## Architecture Components

### 1. Quest Generation Engine
**Purpose**: Core AI service for generating quest content using existing Gemini integration

**Key Features**:
- Leverage existing Gemini API integration (already implemented in `backend/routes/ai_quest_generator.py`)
- Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash model for cost-effective generation
- Existing fallback to OpenAI/Anthropic APIs if needed
- Template-based prompting system for consistent output
- Multi-stage generation process:
  1. Quest idea generation
  2. Content expansion
  3. Validation criteria creation
  4. XP calculation
  5. Quality check

**Input Parameters**:
- Skill category (reading_writing, thinking_skills, etc.)
- Difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Subject area (optional)
- Theme/topic (optional)
- Target time commitment (hours)
- Learning objectives

**Output Format**:
```json
{
  "title": "Quest Title",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "skill_category": "category_key",
  "difficulty_level": "level",
  "estimated_hours": 5,
  "xp_reward": 100,
  "prerequisites": [],
  "learning_objectives": [],
  "instructions": "Step-by-step instructions",
  "completion_criteria": "How to validate completion",
  "resources": [],
  "tags": [],
  "subject": "subject_name"
}
```

### 2. Prompt Engineering System
**Purpose**: Manage and optimize prompts for different quest types

**Components**:
- **Base Prompts Library**:
  - Skill category-specific prompts
  - Difficulty level templates
  - Subject area guidelines
  
- **Dynamic Prompt Builder** (Enhance existing `generate_quest_prompt` function):
  - Extends current prompt generation in `ai_quest_generator.py`
  - Already includes existing quest titles for deduplication
  - Already enforces skill categories and XP guidelines
  - To enhance: Add more sophisticated parameter injection

- **Prompt Templates**:
  ```
  # Based on existing Gemini prompt in ai_quest_generator.py
  System: You are a creative educational quest designer for high school students using a self-directed learning platform.
  
  Context: [Include existing quest titles to avoid duplication]
  
  Task: Generate [count] unique quests with:
  - Specific, concrete accomplishments (not broad topics)
  - Action-focused titles (what will be achieved)
  - Takes approximately [hours] hours to complete
  - Appropriate XP awards based on effort level
  - Evidence requirements for self-validation
  
  Constraints:
  - Age-appropriate for teenagers
  - Real-world application of skills
  - Students already have their diploma - evidence is for self-validation
  - Must use exact skill_category values from the system
  ```

### 3. Quality Assurance Pipeline
**Purpose**: Ensure generated quests meet quality standards

**Validation Steps**:
1. **Content Validation**:
   - Check for inappropriate content
   - Verify educational value
   - Ensure clear instructions

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - XP awards match difficulty/time
   - Skill category alignment
   - Prerequisite logic

3. **Duplicate Detection**:
   - Compare with existing quests
   - Flag similar content for review

4. **Scoring System**:
   - Rate quests on quality metrics
   - Auto-approve high scores
   - Flag low scores for human review

### 4. Admin Interface
**Purpose**: Manage AI generation and review process

**Features**:
1. **Generation Dashboard**:
   - Batch generation controls
   - Parameter configuration
   - Generation history

2. **Review Queue**:
   - List of generated quests pending review
   - Side-by-side comparison with similar quests
   - Quick edit capabilities
   - Approve/reject/modify actions

3. **Analytics**:
   - Generation success rates
   - Category distribution
   - Quality scores over time

### 5. Database Schema Updates
**New Tables**:
```sql
-- ai_generation_jobs
- id
- parameters (JSONB)
- status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- generated_count
- approved_count
- created_at
- completed_at

-- ai_generated_quests
- id
- generation_job_id
- quest_data (JSONB)
- quality_score
- review_status (pending, approved, rejected, modified)
- review_notes
- reviewer_id
- created_at
- reviewed_at
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Generation (Week 1-2)
1. Extend existing Gemini API integration in `ai_quest_generator.py`
2. Enhance current prompt templates for bulk generation
3. Build bulk generation endpoint (extend `/api/ai-quests/generate`)
4. Generate 10 test quests per category using existing infrastructure

### Phase 2: Quality & Review (Week 3-4)
1. Implement quality scoring algorithm
2. Build admin review interface
3. Add duplicate detection
4. Create approval workflow

### Phase 3: Bulk Operations (Week 5-6)
1. Batch generation system
2. Parameter variations
3. Progress tracking
4. Error handling and retries

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 7-8)
1. Prompt refinement based on feedback
2. A/B testing different prompts
3. Cost optimization
4. Performance improvements

## API Endpoints

### Generation Endpoints (Building on existing)
```
# Existing endpoint to enhance:
POST /api/ai-quests/generate
  - Currently generates 5 quests
  - Extend to support batch parameters

# New endpoints to add:
POST /api/admin/quests/generate-batch
  - Bulk generation using Gemini
  - Body: { count, distribution, parameters, theme }
  - Uses existing call_gemini_api function

GET /api/admin/quests/generation-jobs
  - List generation jobs and status

GET /api/admin/quests/review-queue
  - Get quests pending review
```

### Review Endpoints
```
POST /api/admin/quests/review/:id
  - Approve/reject/modify quest
  - Body: { action, modifications, notes }

GET /api/admin/quests/quality-metrics
  - Analytics on generation quality
```

## Cost Considerations

### API Costs (Using Gemini)
- Gemini 1.5 Flash: ~$0.00015 per quest (significantly cheaper than GPT-4)
- Gemini 1.5 Pro: ~$0.001 per quest (for higher quality)
- Target: Generate 1000 quests for ~$0.15-1.00 (Gemini Flash)

### Optimization Strategies
1. Continue using Gemini 1.5 Flash for bulk generation (already configured)
2. Use Gemini 1.5 Pro for complex or high-value quests
3. Leverage existing fallback system (OpenAI/Anthropic) if Gemini fails
4. Batch API calls to reduce overhead
5. Store and reuse successful prompts
