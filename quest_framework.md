The Unified Quest Framework
Core Philosophy: The Process is the Goal
Every quest designed for this platform must be built on a single, core tenet: the process and goal of education are one and the same. A quest is not a task to be checked off to impress a future employer or college; it is an experience to be undertaken for its own sake.

Our goal is to move beyond the "prove you did it" model of traditional education. Instead, we aim to inspire students to do, create, and reflect. This framework uses visual cues and a layered design to make quests feel more like an adventure and less like an assignment.

All quests must follow this framework.

The Foundation: The Five Diploma Pillars
Every quest is grounded in one of the five pillars. Each pillar has a unique icon and color that will be used consistently across the platform to provide immediate visual context.

The Anatomy of a Visual Quest
Each quest is presented as a series of collapsible, icon-driven sections. This allows students to get the big picture at a glance and dive into the details as they're ready.

1. The Quest Header (Always Visible)
This is the quest's "cover." It's visually engaging and provides the most critical information instantly.

quest_banner_image (URL, Optional): A visually appealing, abstract image or pattern related to the quest's theme. This can be AI-generated to be scalable.

primary_pillar_icon (Enum): The icon for the quest's main pillar is prominently displayed.

title (Text): The compelling, action-oriented title.

Good: "Launch a Podcast Mini-Series"

Bad: "Learn About Podcasting"

big_idea (Text): The single, powerful sentence explaining the quest's purpose.

Example: "Share your voice and ideas with the world by creating and publishing a three-episode podcast on a topic you love."

Key Info Bar: A clean, icon-driven summary of key stats.

‚è±Ô∏è estimated_time: "10-15 hours"

‚ú® total_xp: "350 XP"

üë• collaboration: "2x XP Bonus"

2. The Core Sections (Collapsible)
These sections are collapsed by default, with clear, icon-driven headers. Clicking on a header expands the section.

showcase_your_journey (Text): The prompt that reframes "evidence" as a celebration of the work and the process.
