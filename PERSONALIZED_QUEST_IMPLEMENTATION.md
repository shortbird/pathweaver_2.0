# Personalized Quest System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete transformation of the quest system from predefined global tasks to AI-personalized, user-specific task generation. Students now work with AI to create custom learning paths aligned with their interests and cross-curricular goals.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### New Tables Created
- **`user_quest_tasks`** - User-specific tasks (replaces global `quest_tasks`)
  - Links to user_id, quest_id, and user_quest_id
  - Supports manual student-created tasks with approval workflow
  - Tracks task properties: title, description, pillar, xp_value, order_index

- **`task_collaborations`** - Task-level teamwork (replaces quest-level collaboration)
  - Enables students to collaborate on individual tasks
  - Awards double XP when tasks are completed together
  - Supports cross-quest collaboration on similar activities

- **`quest_personalization_sessions`** - Tracks AI personalization workflow
  - Stores selected approach, interests, cross-curricular subjects
  - Caches AI-generated and finalized tasks
  - Links to user_quests for tracking completion status

- **`ai_task_cache`** - Performance optimization
  - Caches AI-generated tasks based on interest/subject combinations
  - 7-day expiration with hit count tracking
  - Reduces API costs and improves response times

#### Tables Modified
- **`user_quests`** - Added personalization tracking
  - `personalization_completed` boolean flag
  - `personalization_session_id` FK reference

- **`quest_task_completions`** - Updated references
  - Added `user_quest_task_id` column for new task system

#### Tables Removed
- **`quest_tasks`** → Archived as `quest_tasks_archived`
- **`quest_collaborations`** → Archived as `quest_collaborations_archived`
- **`quest_ratings`** → Archived as `quest_ratings_archived`

### 2. Backend Services

#### `personalization_service.py` - Core AI Personalization
- `TaskCacheService` - Caching layer for AI-generated tasks
- `PersonalizationService` - Main service for quest personalization
  - `start_personalization_session()` - Initialize/resume sessions
  - `generate_task_suggestions()` - AI task generation with caching
  - `refine_task()` - Student task editing with AI enhancement
  - `finalize_personalization()` - Create user-specific tasks

#### Key Features
- **AI Task Generation**: Uses gemini-2.5-flash-lite model
- **XP Distribution**: Enforces 50%+ tasks at 100 XP
- **Cross-Curricular Integration**: Links multiple subjects per task
- **Interest-Based**: Incorporates student interests authentically
- **Caching Strategy**: MD5 hash of interests/subjects for cache keys

### 3. API Routes

#### Quest Personalization (`/api/quests/...`)
- `POST /<quest_id>/start-personalization` - Begin personalization flow
- `POST /<quest_id>/generate-tasks` - AI task generation
- `POST /<quest_id>/refine-tasks` - Regenerate with different inputs
- `POST /<quest_id>/edit-task` - Student edits task (AI reformats)
- `POST /<quest_id>/add-manual-task` - Add custom task (needs approval)
- `POST /<quest_id>/finalize-tasks` - Complete personalization
- `GET /<quest_id>/personalization-status` - Check completion status

#### Task Collaboration (`/api/tasks/...`)
- `POST /<task_id>/invite-collaborator` - Invite friend to task
- `PUT /<task_id>/collaboration/accept` - Accept collaboration
- `PUT /<task_id>/collaboration/decline` - Decline invitation
- `POST /<task_id>/collaboration/complete` - Award double XP
- `GET /<task_id>/collaborations` - Get collaboration status

#### Admin Task Approval (`/api/v3/admin/manual-tasks/...`)
- `GET /pending` - List student-created tasks awaiting approval
- `PUT /<task_id>/approve` - Approve student task
- `PUT /<task_id>/reject` - Reject with feedback
- `DELETE /<task_id>` - Delete rejected task
- `GET /stats` - Approval statistics

### 4. AI Integration

#### Personalization Prompt Template
```
You are helping a student personalize their learning quest: "{quest_title}".

Student's Selected Approach: {approach_description}
Student's Interests: {interests_list}
Cross-Curricular Integration: {subjects_list}

Generate 6-10 tasks that:
1. Are equivalent to high school unit projects
2. At least 50% of tasks should be worth exactly 100 XP
3. Each task assigned to one of five pillars
4. Incorporate student's interests authentically
5. Integrate cross-curricular subjects naturally
6. Follow selected approach (real-world project, traditional class, or hybrid)
7. Are personalized and engaging

Return JSON with: title, description, pillar, xp_value, evidence_prompt, cross_curricular_connections
```

#### Three Approach Options
- **Option A (Real-World Project)**: Personalized project aligned with interests
- **Option B (Traditional Class)**: Structured curriculum approach (e.g., Khan Academy)
- **Option C (Hybrid)**: Combination of traditional + personalized project

### 5. Migration Script

#### `personalized_quests_migration.py`
- **Step 1**: Create new tables with proper indexes
- **Step 2**: Migrate quest_tasks → user_quest_tasks for active enrollments
- **Step 3**: Migrate quest_collaborations → task_collaborations
- **Step 4**: Update quest_task_completions FK references
- **Step 5**: Update user_quests with personalization columns
- **Step 6**: Archive old tables with `_archived` suffix

#### Safety Features
- Zero-downtime migration strategy
- Comprehensive data backup before changes
- 1-week archive period before table deletion
- Detailed logging and error handling

## Important Notes & Disclaimers

### AI Guidance Disclaimer
**CRITICAL**: Must display this disclaimer prominently in the personalization wizard:

> "AI is a useful tool to help us refine our ideas, but YOU should make the final decisions. These suggestions need to truly be CHOSEN by you, not just agreed to because an AI model suggested them. We strongly recommend scheduling time with an Optio teacher to complete this process together."

### Manual Task Approval
- All student-created tasks require admin approval
- Prevents gaming the system with easy tasks
- Ensures quality and educational value
- Admin can approve/reject with feedback

### AI Quality Control
- All AI-generated tasks initially require admin review (can be relaxed later)
- Extensive prompt engineering for quality
- Human oversight during rollout phase
- Monitor task quality scores and student feedback

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: AI generates poor quality tasks
**Mitigation**:
- Admin approval for all AI tasks initially
- Extensive prompt testing and refinement
- Quality scoring and feedback loop

### Risk: Performance issues with AI calls
**Mitigation**:
- Aggressive caching strategy
- Async processing where possible
- 5-second timeout on AI generation
- Fallback to cached results

### Risk: Data loss during migration
**Mitigation**:
- Full database backup before migration
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
- 1-week archive period for rollback
- Comprehensive testing in develop

### Risk: Student gaming the system
**Mitigation**:
- Admin approval for manual tasks
- XP value validation (50-200 range)
- Quality checks on task descriptions
- Monitor completion patterns
