   - Created frontend/src/pages/courses/CourseCatalog.jsx (COMPLETE)
   - Backend endpoint already exists: POST /api/courses/:id/enroll (verified)
   - BLOCKED: Could not add route to App.jsx due to concurrent modifications

BLOCKED (concurrent file edits):
3. ✗ task_1767035325436_lesson_crud.json
   - Integrate LessonEditor into CourseBuilder.jsx
   - BLOCKED: CourseBuilder.jsx being actively modified by other workers
   - LessonEditor component exists and is ready to integrate

NOTES:
- Multiple workers editing shared files (App.jsx, CourseBuilder.jsx) causes conflicts
- Tasks requiring changes to actively-edited files should be retried after other workers complete
- All blocked tasks have dependencies verified and are ready to implement

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Retry blocked tasks after worker coordination
- Consider task ordering to minimize concurrent edits to same files
