    "description": "Fix should show error for invalid credentials test (line 41). Currently uses weak assertion (just stays on login page). From LoginPage.jsx lines 53-62, the error div uses: div.bg-red-50.border-l-4.border-red-500 with text in p.text-red-800. Fix by: 1) Use selector div.bg-red-50.border-l-4 or text element .text-red-800, 2) Wait for network to settle after form submission, 3) Increase timeout to 10 seconds for error to appear, 4) MUST assert the error div is visible - remove the weak fallback that just checks we stayed on login page."
