    "description": "Fix should persist session across page refreshes test (line 113). Currently skips if session doesn't persist, blaming headless browser cookie issues. Session persistence is vital and test should FAIL not skip. Fix by: 1) Wait longer for session to establish before reload (wait for authenticated content), 2) Wait for any token refresh to complete, 3) After reload, check for authenticated content not just URL, 4) If session doesn't persist, test must FAIL with helpful diagnostic info (not test.skip()), 5) Add logging to help debug: log cookie state, localStorage, current URL before/after reload."
