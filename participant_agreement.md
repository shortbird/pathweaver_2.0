Founder Studio Participant Handbook
Introduction
This handbook outlines how things work at Founder Studio. It’s not a list of rules to memorize, but a guide to the professional culture we're building together. Read it, understand it, and help us make this a productive environment for everyone.
Our Philosophy
Our model is simple: you do your best work when you're in control. We provide the space, resources, and mentorship. The drive and the ownership must come from you. This program is for self-directed people who are ready to be responsible for their own outcomes.
Your Program
My Achievement Plan (MAP)
The My Achievement Plan (MAP) is the center of your work here. It’s not a syllabus; it’s a strategic plan you will create with your parents and Studio Guide to build and launch a real-world venture.
Your Goals: The MAP is built around the high-level business or project goals you want to accomplish.
The Steps: We'll help you break down each goal into smaller, concrete milestones to guide your work.
Your Guide: Your Studio Guide is your mentor and accountability partner. They are here to help you solve problems, connect you with resources, and monitor your progress.
Stay Flexible: Your MAP is a living document that will be adapted as your project evolves.
Showcase Nights
Several times a year, we host Showcase Nights. These are your opportunity to present your work to the community, get direct feedback, and mark your progress.


Studio Life
Code of Conduct
Own Your Success: Your progress is up to you. We expect you to be "fully bought-in”. This means you are actively working on your MAP goals because you are internally motivated, not because of external pressure.
Maintain a Professional Environment: We share our space with other professionals. You are expected to act with maturity, respect the shared workspaces and equipment, and contribute positively to the community.
Respect Everyone: The Studio must be a safe and professional space for all. Bullying, harassment, and discrimination are not tolerated.
The Open Campus: Freedom and Responsibility
The Studio is not a traditional school. We trust you to manage yourself, your time, and your work. This is what that means day-to-day:
You Are in Charge of You: We do not provide supervision. Our staff and mentors are here to guide your projects, not to monitor your movements.
Freedom to Come and Go: The Studio is an open campus. You are free to arrive and leave as your work requires.
We Don't Take Attendance: Success is measured by your progress, not by hours spent in the building.
Transportation is Your Responsibility: You and your parents are responsible for your transportation to and from the Studio.
Your Choices Are Your Own: You are responsible for your actions and your safety, especially if you decide to leave the campus during the day.
Daily Basics
Workspace: You have access to the Studio workspace and resources during business hours.
Food & Drink: You are responsible for your own meals, drinks, and snacks.
Health & Safety
In an Emergency
In a medical emergency, we will use the contact information your parents provided. If we cannot reach them, we will get you the necessary medical help.
Being Smart and Safe
Building a venture involves risks. At the Studio, these include:
Using professional-grade tools in the makerspace (mandatory safety training is required before use).
Working in a professional environment with other people.
Having the freedom to come and go from the building.
Your parents acknowledged these risks in the agreement they signed. We expect you to make safe choices for yourself and others.
The Fine Print
How the Studio is Funded: A Shared Responsibility
The Founder Studio is funded entirely by sponsors. This model only works if we can demonstrate our value to the people and companies who support us. That makes securing funding a shared responsibility. Here is your role:
Professionalism: Our sponsors are investing in a professional environment. Your conduct directly reflects on the Studio and its viability.
Quality of Work: Your projects are our primary results. High-quality, ambitious work is the best justification for a sponsor's investment.
Sponsor Sourcing: We expect you to contribute to finding potential sponsors. This is part of the entrepreneurial process.
The bottom line is that our ability to operate depends on securing sponsorships. We all share that responsibility.
Your Work & Your Story
Your Ideas Are Yours: The intellectual property for your business belongs to you. You grant the Studio a license to showcase your work for educational and promotional purposes.
Sharing Our Story: We regularly document and share work from the Studio for promotional purposes. This may include using your image, voice, or projects in our materials.
Using Online Tools: We use various online platforms for business and education. Your parents gave us permission to sign you up for these tools as needed.
Our Commitment and Yours
This program requires a high level of motivation and self-direction. We reserve the right to end a participant's enrollment if the Studio is no longer a good fit, for reasons including policy violations, lack of engagement, or otherwise.
