WHAT TO EXPECT ON OUR CALL

We'll spend about 30 minutes in a collaborative conversation about your family. I want to hear about your child's interests, your vision for their education, and how we might work together as partners in their learning journey.

Think of it as a planning session with a colleague - no sales pitch, just a genuine exploration of whether Optio is the right fit for your family.

Before our call, I recommend exploring these resources to get a sense of what's possible:

• Try our 2-minute interactive demo: https://www.optioeducation.com/demo
• Read about our philosophy: https://www.optioeducation.com
• Think about what questions matter most to you

Have questions before we meet? Simply reply to this email - I respond personally to every message. A consultation is not the only way to get in touch.

Looking forward to connecting with you!
