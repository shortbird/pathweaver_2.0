# Postgres Version Upgrade Plan

## Current Status
- **Current Version**: supabase-postgres-17.4.1.074
- **Issue**: Security patches available for current version
- **Security Level**: WARN
- **Impact**: Medium - security vulnerability exposure

## Upgrade Process

### Pre-Upgrade Checklist
1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Supabase automatically creates backups, but verify recent backups exist
   - Export critical data if needed for extra safety
   - Document current database schema and functions

2. **Testing Plan**
   - Schedule upgrade during low-traffic period (e.g., weekend night)
   - Prepare rollback plan in case of issues
   - Have monitoring ready for post-upgrade validation

3. **Application Compatibility**
   - Current application uses Supabase client library - should be compatible
   - All functions use standard PostgreSQL features
   - No known compatibility issues expected

### Upgrade Steps (Coordinate with Supabase Support)

1. **Contact Supabase Support**
   - Open support ticket requesting Postgres version upgrade
   - Reference security advisory: vulnerable_postgres_version
   - Request upgrade to latest stable version with security patches

2. **Schedule Maintenance Window**
   - Coordinate timing with Supabase support
   - Notify users of potential downtime (if any)
   - Ensure development team is available for testing

3. **Post-Upgrade Validation**
   - Verify all database functions work correctly
   - Test critical application flows:
     - User authentication
     - Quest completion
     - AI Tutor functionality
     - Subscription management
     - Community features
   - Monitor error logs for any issues
   - Run Supabase Security Advisor again to verify fix

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: Low-Medium
- **Potential Issues**:
  - Brief downtime during upgrade
  - Function compatibility (unlikely with our current functions)
  - Performance changes (usually improvements)

### Rollback Plan
- Supabase handles rollbacks if needed
- Contact support immediately if issues arise
- Have list of critical functionality to test quickly

### Timeline
- **Immediate**: Contact Supabase support to schedule upgrade
- **Within 1 week**: Execute upgrade during maintenance window
- **Post-upgrade**: Monitor for 48 hours for any issues

## Notes
- This is a Supabase-managed upgrade, not something we execute directly
- The upgrade addresses security vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL version
- All our database functions and schemas should be compatible
