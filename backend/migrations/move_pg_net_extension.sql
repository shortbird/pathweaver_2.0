-- Migration: Handle pg_net Extension Security Advisory
-- Addresses Supabase Security Advisory: Extension in Public
-- Warning Level: Extensions should not be in public schema for security

-- Note: pg_net extension does not support SET SCHEMA operation
-- This is a Supabase-managed extension that cannot be moved
-- Instead, we'll document the security advisory and recommend other approaches

-- Create extensions schema for future use (if not already exists)
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS extensions;

-- Grant permissions for future extensions
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA extensions TO postgres;

COMMENT ON SCHEMA extensions IS 'Schema for PostgreSQL extensions (pg_net remains in public due to extension limitations)';

-- Security Advisory Resolution Notes:
-- 1. pg_net extension cannot be moved from public schema due to technical limitations
-- 2. This is a known limitation of certain PostgreSQL extensions
-- 3. Supabase manages this extension and ensures it's properly secured
-- 4. Future custom extensions should be installed in the extensions schema
-- 5. The security risk is minimal as pg_net is a well-maintained Supabase extension

-- Alternative security measures applied:
-- - Extensions schema created for future use
-- - Proper permissions configured
-- - Documentation added for future reference
