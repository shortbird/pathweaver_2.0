1. Introduction and Core Philosophy
This Agreement governs the Participant's enrollment in the Founder Studio. Its purpose is to create a clear understanding of the Studio's unique model, mutual responsibilities, financial commitments, and operational policies. The Studio operates on the philosophy of a "liberated environment with firm boundaries." We provide access to facilities, mentorship, and a framework for entrepreneurial development. We do not provide direct supervision or assume custodial care. The Participant is expected to be self-motivated and take primary responsibility for their success.
This Agreement incorporates the Founder Studio Participant Handbook ("Handbook") by reference. The Parent and Participant agree they have received, read, and will abide by the Handbook.
2. The "Open Campus" Model and Acknowledgment of No Supervision
This section is critical to understanding the Studio's operating model. By signing this Agreement, you explicitly acknowledge and agree to the following terms:
Recreational Center Model: The Studio is structured similarly to a recreational or innovation center. The Participant is paying for access to the facilities, resources, and the opportunity to interact with staff and mentors.
No Supervision or Custodial Care: The Studio DOES NOT provide childcare, babysitting, or custodial supervision for any Participant, regardless of age. Staff and mentors are present to provide educational and entrepreneurial guidance, not to monitor or supervise Participants.
Freedom of Movement: The Studio operates as an OPEN CAMPUS. Participants are free to arrive, depart, and move about the premises and surrounding areas at will.
No Monitoring of Arrival or Departure: Studio staff DO NOT monitor when Participants arrive or leave the facility. We are not responsible for ensuring a Participant's attendance on any given day.
Parental Responsibility for Transportation and Pickup: Parents are solely responsible for the Participant's transportation to and from the facility. The Studio DOES NOT verify the identity of the person picking up a Participant. It is the Parent's responsibility to coordinate safe transportation and communicate authorized persons directly with their child.
Actions Outside the Studio: The Studio is not responsible for the Participant's actions or safety when they are off-site, even if they leave during normal operating hours.
3. Program and Financial Details
Program: The Participant is enrolling in the Founder Studio program, which is focused on launching a business venture through a personalized "My Achievement Plan" (MAP).
Non-Accredited Program: The Participant and Parent acknowledge that the Founder Studio is a non-accredited program. While the Studio provides pathways and support for obtaining an accredited high school diploma or other degrees through partner organizations, the Studio itself does not confer accredited academic credentials.
Program Fee and Payment: The Studio relies on sponsorships to fund this program. We hope to cover the full cost through sponsorships, and we welcome assistance from parents and community partners to help fund the school.
No Guarantee of Success: The Studio provides tools, mentorship, and a framework to support entrepreneurs. However, the Studio makes no warranty or guarantee of any specific business outcome, including but not limited to revenue, profit, investment, or market success, notwithstanding any optimism or assurances that the Participant or Parent receives from any Studio mentor.
4. Participant's Business Entity (Optional)
Business Entity Formation: The Parent and Participant acknowledge that should they choose to formalize the Participant's venture into a legal business entity, they are solely responsible for the process, cost, and administration of formation and maintenance. The Studio does not require the formation of a business entity for participation in the program.
Studio is Not a Partner: The Studio is an educational service provider and is not a partner, owner, or fiduciary of the Participant or Participant's business.
Business Liabilities: Should a business be formed, the Parent and Participant are solely responsible for all its legal, financial, tax, and operational liabilities. The Studio provides educational guidance only and is not a legal, tax, or financial advisor. Participants are encouraged to seek independent legal, tax, and financial advice.
5. Health, Safety, and Medical Authorization
Health Information: The Parent agrees to provide complete and accurate Participant health information and to update the Studio immediately of any changes.
Emergency Medical Authorization: In the event of a medical emergency where the Parent cannot be reached after reasonable attempts, the Parent grants the Studio permission to seek and obtain emergency medical treatment for the Participant.
Financial Responsibility: The Parent agrees to assume full financial responsibility for any and all costs of emergency medical care and transportation.
6. Assumption of Risk, Waiver, and Indemnification
Acknowledgment and Assumption of Inherent Risks: The Parent and Participant acknowledge that participation in any entrepreneurial, project-based, or workshop activity carries inherent risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, those arising from:
The unsupervised, open campus environment.
Makerspace and Equipment Use: Use of tools and equipment within the Studio's makerspace, including but not limited to 3D printers, a plasma cutter, and Cricut machines. The Participant understands and agrees that they must complete mandatory safety training for each piece of equipment before they are authorized to use it.
Interaction with other participants and members of the public.
Transportation to and from off-site activities (if any).
The freedom of the Participant to leave the premises at any time.
The Parent and Participant knowingly and voluntarily assume all such inherent risks, both known and unknown.
Parental Waiver of Liability (Limited Scope): On behalf of themselves (the Parent), their heirs, and their estate, the Parent releases, waives, and agrees not to sue the Studio, its officers, employees, and agents for any loss, damage, or injury arising from the inherent risks of participation.
Acknowledgement of Utah Law Regarding Minors: The Parent explicitly acknowledges and understands that, in accordance with Utah public policy and law, this agreement DOES NOT AND CANNOT waive or release any legal claim the Participant (minor) may have against the Studio for injuries caused by the Studio's own NEGLIGENCE. This waiver does not protect the Studio from liability for its gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or intentional wrongdoing.
Parental Indemnification: The Parent agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Studio from any and all claims, lawsuits, and expenses (including attorney's fees) brought by or on behalf of the Participant against the Studio related to their participation, except for claims resulting from the Studio's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
7. Media, IP, and Technology Consent
Media Release: The Parent and Participant grant the Studio permission to use the Participant's image, voice, and work in promotional and educational materials without compensation.
Intellectual Property: The intellectual property of the Participant's business belongs to the Participant or their business entity. The Participant grants the Studio a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to showcase the Participant's work for non-commercial, educational, and promotional purposes.
Third-Party Technology: The Parent authorizes the Studio to act as their agent in consenting to the use of approved third-party educational and business software/platforms as needed for the program, in compliance with COPPA.
8. Dispute Resolution
Any dispute arising from this Agreement will first be addressed through good-faith informal discussion. If unresolved, the dispute shall be submitted to mediation. If mediation fails, the dispute will be resolved through individual final and binding arbitration in Utah County, Utah. By signing this Agreement, you are waiving the right to a jury trial and the right to participate in a class-action lawsuit.
9. Modification of Agreement
The Studio reserves the right to amend or modify this Agreement and the incorporated Handbook at any time in its sole discretion. The Studio will provide notice of any material changes to the Parent's primary email address on file. Continued participation in the program after such notice will constitute acceptance of the modified terms.
10. Termination of Participation
The Studio reserves the right to terminate a Participant's enrollment in the program at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion. Such termination may occur without prior notice and may be for reasons including, but not limited to, violations of the Handbook, disruptive behavior, non-payment of fees (if applicable), or if the Studio determines the program is no longer a suitable fit for the Participant.
