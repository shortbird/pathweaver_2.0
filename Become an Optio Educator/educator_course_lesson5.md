# Lesson 5: Every Student Gets an IEP

Let me tell you about two students I had in the same class.

Marcus was "officially" a special needs student. He had an IEP - an Individualized Education Program - that spelled out accommodations: extra time on tests, preferential seating, chunked assignments, frequent check-ins. The document was pages long.

Sophia had no diagnosis. No paperwork. No accommodations. She was a "general education" student.

But Sophia needed just as much individualization as Marcus. She processed information slowly and needed time to think before responding. She got overwhelmed by long assignments. She did her best work in the morning and completely shut down after lunch.

The difference wasn't in their needs. It was in the paperwork.

## The Problem With "Special" Needs

In traditional education, there's a line. On one side: "typical" students who get the standard experience. On the other: "special needs" students who get accommodations.

To cross that line, you need a diagnosis. You need evaluations. You need meetings and paperwork and legal documents. You need a 504 plan or an IEP.

And then - only then - do you get the basic dignity of having your individual needs acknowledged.

Here's what's wild about this: *everyone* has individual learning needs. Everyone processes information differently. Everyone has strengths and struggles. Everyone learns better under certain conditions.

But we've built a system that only recognizes this for a subset of students - the ones with the right paperwork.

The rest? They're expected to adapt to the system, rather than the system adapting to them.

## What 504s and IEPs Actually Are

If you're not familiar with these terms:

A **504 plan** (named after Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) provides accommodations for students with disabilities. It removes barriers. Extra time, modified assignments, different seating - whatever helps level the playing field.

An **IEP** (Individualized Education Program) goes further. It's a legally binding document that specifies not just accommodations but goals, services, and specially designed instruction. It's created by a team including teachers, specialists, and parents.

Both recognize a fundamental truth: *some students need a different approach to succeed*.

The problem isn't the documents themselves. The problem is the implication that only *some* students need this. That individualization is an exception, not the rule.

## Universal Design for Learning

There's a concept in architecture called Universal Design. It started with a simple observation: when you design buildings for people in wheelchairs, you end up with buildings that work better for everyone.

Ramps help wheelchair users, yes. But they also help people with strollers, delivery workers with carts, elderly people with canes, anyone carrying heavy equipment.

Designing for the "edge cases" improves things for everyone.

Education researchers took this idea and ran with it. They called it Universal Design for Learning - UDL.

The core insight: instead of designing instruction for the "average" student and then retrofitting accommodations for those who don't fit, design instruction that's flexible from the start.

Give everyone:
- **Multiple means of engagement** - different ways to get interested and stay motivated
- **Multiple means of representation** - different ways to encounter information
- **Multiple means of action and expression** - different ways to show what you know

Sound familiar? This maps directly onto Self-Determination Theory. Multiple means of engagement supports *choice*. Multiple means of representation and expression supports *competence* - meeting students where they are. And all of it, done in community, supports *connection*.

## At Optio, Everyone Gets an IEP

Here's the shift we've made:

Traditional system: Standardized instruction for most, individualized support for some.

Optio: Individualized experience for everyone.

Every student interacts with the same curriculum. They're all working on the same projects, engaging with the same ideas. But *how* they engage is completely customized.

A student who needs to move slowly through material can do that. A student who wants to sprint ahead can do that. A student who learns best by watching videos, or reading, or doing, or discussing - they can approach the material their way.

A student who needs extra time doesn't need special paperwork. Extra time is just... how it works. Everyone moves at their own pace.

A student who needs to demonstrate learning differently doesn't need an accommodation request. They choose their evidence format from the start.

A student who struggles with executive function - who needs tasks broken into smaller steps, who needs visual progress indicators, who needs frequent feedback - doesn't need a special plan. That's just how the platform is designed.

We didn't build a system and then add accommodations. We built the accommodations in from the beginning.

## Same Material, Different Brains

I want to be clear about what this is and isn't.

It's not "everyone learns differently so everyone gets different content." That leads to tracking and segregation and all the problems that come with it.

All students engage with the same rich, challenging material. The curriculum doesn't get watered down. The expectations don't change.

What changes is the *path*.

Think about a mountain. Everyone's trying to reach the same summit. But there are many routes up. Some people take the switchbacks. Some scramble straight up. Some pause at camps along the way. Some practically run.

The destination is shared. The journey is individual.

This is what it looks like when you take UDL seriously. Not "different students get different stuff." But "all students get flexible access to the same meaningful learning."

---

## Why This Matters

When I was teaching, I watched students without IEPs struggle silently. They didn't have the "right" diagnosis to get help. Or their parents didn't know how to navigate the system. Or they'd internalized that needing help meant something was wrong with them.

Meanwhile, I watched students with IEPs get accommodations that would have helped everyone - but were treated as special exceptions rather than better design.

The whole thing was backwards.

At Optio, we stopped asking "which students need individualization?" and started asking "how do we individualize for every student?"

The answer: build it into the architecture. Make flexibility the default. Design for the edges, and watch everyone benefit.

Every student has a unique brain. Every student has a unique personality. Every student has their own way of learning best.

Why would we only acknowledge that for some of them?

## Your Reflection

Before moving on, think about this:

Think of a student you've worked with who *didn't* have an IEP or 504, but probably could have used one. What did they need that the system didn't provide?

Now think about how you might have supported them if individualization was just... how things worked. If you didn't need paperwork or justification. If flexibility was the default.

What would have been different?
