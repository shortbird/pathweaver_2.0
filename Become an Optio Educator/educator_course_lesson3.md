# Lesson 3: The Words We Choose

I want to tell you about something I said to a student once.

She'd just finished a really solid project. Put real effort into it. And I said, without thinking: "This is going to look great on your college applications."

She smiled. Said thanks. But something shifted in her face. And I realized, way too late, what I'd actually communicated.

I'd told her the work itself didn't matter. Only what it could get her.

## Language Reveals Belief

Here's the uncomfortable truth: the words we use tell students what we actually believe about learning. Not what we say we believe. What we *actually* believe.

And most of us, if we're honest, have been trained to believe that learning is a means to an end. So that's what comes out of our mouths.

"This will help you in the future."
"Employers look for this skill."
"You'll thank me later."
"This is important for your career."

Every one of these phrases sends the same message: *the learning itself isn't valuable. Only the outcome is.*

Compare:

| What We Often Say | What We Could Say |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "This will help you in the future" | "You're building something real right now" |
| "Employers will be impressed" | "You should be proud of what you're creating" |
| "Build your resume" | "Build your skills" |
| "Prove yourself" | "Discover yourself" |
| "Get ahead" | "Keep growing" |
| "Stand out from others" | "Become more yourself" |

Left column: learning as transaction.
Right column: learning as transformation.

## The Phrases We Don't Even Notice

Some of this language is so baked into education culture that we don't hear it anymore.

"Don't fall behind."
"You need to catch up."
"How do you compare to your peers?"
"This will give you a competitive edge."

Every one of these implies a race. Winners and losers. People ahead and people behind.

But learning isn't a race. There's no finish line. There's no "behind." There's just... where you are, and where you're going.

When we use competition language, we're not just describing reality. We're creating it. We're teaching students that learning is about beating other people, not becoming themselves.

## This Isn't About Scripts

Look, I'm not saying you need to memorize a bunch of approved phrases. That would be weird and robotic and students would see right through it.

What I'm saying is: pay attention.

Notice what comes out of your mouth. Notice the assumptions underneath.

When you catch yourself saying "this will be useful someday," ask yourself: what am I teaching about today?

When you're about to say "employers want to see this," pause. Is there a way to acknowledge the value of the work itself?

Your voice is your voice. Your relationships with students are yours. I'm not trying to change who you are. I'm just asking you to notice what you're communicating.

## A Confession

I still mess this up. All the time.

Last week I caught myself telling someone their project would "open doors." Doors to what? Who knows. It's just... what came out.

Old habits are stubborn. The transactional language of education is so deeply embedded that it takes real effort to speak differently. And even then, you slip.

That's okay. This isn't about being perfect. It's about being aware. The awareness itself changes things, even when the words don't come out right.

## Your Last Tasks for This Project

**Task 4: Language Inventory**

Write down 10-15 phrases you actually use when you're teaching or talking to students. Be honest. Include the stuff you say without thinking.

Then sort them:
- Which ones focus on future payoff? ("This will help you...")
- Which ones appeal to external validation or comparison? ("Employers want..." / "Stand out from...")
- Which ones celebrate what's happening right now? ("You're figuring out..." / "Look at what you built...")

This isn't about judgment. Most of us are going to find a lot of future-focused, external-validation stuff. That's normal. We were trained this way.

The point is just to see it.

**Task 5: Rewriting Your Voice**

Take the phrases that lean toward future/external, and rewrite them.

The goal isn't to sound like a different person. It's to find *your* way of saying things that still feel like you - but carry a different message.

"This will help you get a job" might become "You're developing a real skill here."

"Colleges will love this" might become "You should feel good about what you made."

Same you. Same relationships. Different underlying belief.

---

When you finish these two tasks, you're done with Project 1.

Take a second to notice what shifted. Not just what you learned - but how you're thinking. What you're noticing that you didn't notice before.

That's the process. And the process is the goal.
