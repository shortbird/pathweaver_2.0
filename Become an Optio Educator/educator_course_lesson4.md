# Lesson 4: Why XP, Not Grades

There's a question I used to hear constantly. It would come right after I finished explaining an assignment. Sometimes before I even finished.

"Is this good enough?"

And its cousin: "What do I have to do to get an A?"

I used to think these were reasonable questions. Students being strategic. Wanting to understand expectations.

But eventually I realized what was actually happening. The moment students asked those questions, they'd already stopped learning.

## The Ceiling Problem

Here's how letter grades work in practice:

A student does work. The work gets evaluated. The evaluation becomes a letter. That letter represents the ceiling.

Once you've hit your target - whether it's an A, or just "passing" - you're done. There's no reason to keep going. The system tells you you've arrived.

"What do I need for an A?" really means "Where can I stop?"

That's not process-focused thinking. That's destination thinking. And destination thinking kills curiosity.

Think about it. A student gets their A. They could keep exploring the material, going deeper, following tangents. But why would they? The game has been won. The box has been checked. Moving on.

Letter grades turn every learning experience into a finish line. And once you cross it, you stop running.

## Grade A Beef

Here's something that might surprise you.

The letter grading system we use in schools? It wasn't designed for education.

It was inherited from the meat industry.

Seriously. The USDA started grading beef in 1927. Prime, Choice, Select. Grade A, Grade B. A system for sorting cattle carcasses by quality.

At some point, schools looked at this system designed for dead animals and said: "Yeah, that seems right for children."

I'm not making a deep argument here. Just... sit with that for a second. The system we use to evaluate human learning was borrowed from butchers.

There might be better models available.

## The Failure Problem

We talk a lot about celebrating failure. Learning from mistakes. Growth mindset. Iteration. All the good stuff.

And then we use a grading system that does the exact opposite.

Letter grades don't just fail to celebrate failure - they're built to punish it. That's the entire architecture. You start with an A, and every mistake subtracts from it. Or you accumulate points, and failures mean you accumulate less.

Either way, the message is clear: failure is bad. Failure costs you. Failure drops you from an A to a B, from passing to failing.

This is baked into the essence of the system. You can't "celebrate failure" while using a mechanism that penalizes it. The medium contradicts the message.

Students learn, very quickly, that the smart move is to avoid risk. Don't try things you might fail at. Stick to what you know. Play it safe.

Is that the kind of learning we want to encourage?

## A Different Scoreboard

Look, I'm not naive. I understand why we need some kind of scoring system.

Students want to know how they're doing. Parents want visibility. Institutions need records. There's a legitimate need to track progress.

But the scoring system doesn't have to be letter grades. We just inherited that one. We could build something else.

So we did.

Experience Points - XP - work differently than grades. The shift is subtle but fundamental.

Grades measure outcomes. XP measures engagement.

With grades, you're asking: "Did you get the right answer?" With XP, you're asking: "Did you engage with the process?"

## XP Rewards the Process

Here's how XP works in Optio:

A student attempts a task. Maybe they succeed. Maybe they fail spectacularly. Either way, they document what they did and what they learned.

And they earn XP for it.

Not for the outcome. For the engagement.

A student who tries something ambitious, fails, documents their failure, reflects on what went wrong, and tries a different approach? They're earning XP the whole time. Every step is progress. Every attempt counts.

Compare that to a grading system where that same student would just... get a low score. Failure documented as failure. No credit for the process. No recognition of the learning that happened along the way.

XP flips the incentive structure. Instead of "avoid failure to protect your grade," it becomes "engage deeply, because engagement is what's measured."

---

## Documenting the Struggle

One thing I love about XP: it makes failure visible in a good way.

In a graded system, students hide their struggles. Failed attempts go in the trash. Wrong turns get erased. The final product is polished to look like it emerged fully formed.

With XP, students are encouraged to document everything. The false starts. The dead ends. The "oh wait, that's completely wrong" moments.

Because that documentation is valuable. It's evidence of learning. It shows that they engaged, that they wrestled with something difficult, that they grew.

A student's XP history becomes a record of their learning journey - not just the destinations, but the whole path. The wrong turns are part of the story.

---

## What This Means in Practice

If you're used to grading, this requires a shift in how you think about student work.

You're not asking: "Is this correct?"
You're asking: "Did this student engage meaningfully with the process?"

You're not looking for: "Did they reach the right destination?"
You're looking for: "Are they on a journey? Are they moving?"

This doesn't mean anything goes. XP isn't participation trophies. Students still need to show genuine engagement. They need to document real attempts. They need to reflect honestly on what they're learning.

But the ceiling is gone. There's no "good enough." There's just: keep going. Keep learning. Keep earning.

And that changes everything about how students approach their work.
