# Lesson 3: Feedback That Grows

A grade is feedback compressed to the point of uselessness.

A+. 87%. Meets expectations.

What is a student supposed to *do* with that?

If all you tell someone is where they landed on a scale, you've told them almost nothing about how to grow. You've just given them a judgment to feel good or bad about.

Real feedback is different. Real feedback is a gift that helps someone get better.

## The Timing Problem

Most feedback comes too late.

You work on something for weeks. You submit it. Days or weeks later, you get a grade and some comments. By then, you've moved on. The work is done. The feedback is for the archive, not for improvement.

Effective feedback comes while you can still use it. While you're in the middle of the struggle. While there's still time to change course.

This is another argument for evidence over proof. When students share their process as they go, you can respond as they go. The feedback loop tightens.

## Present Tense

Here's a small thing that makes a big difference: write feedback in present tense.

Not: "You did a good job here."
But: "You're developing a strong sense of structure."

Not: "This showed understanding."
But: "You're showing real understanding here."

Not: "You struggled with this part."
But: "This is where you're still growing."

Present tense keeps the focus on the ongoing journey. It suggests that learning is still happening, not finished. It positions the student as someone in motion, not someone being evaluated.

## Growth, Not Judgment

There's a kind of feedback that sounds positive but isn't helpful:

"Great job!"
"This is excellent!"
"I'm so impressed!"

It feels nice. It doesn't help anyone grow.

And there's a kind of feedback that sounds critical but isn't helpful either:

"This doesn't meet the standard."
"You need to work on X."
"This part is wrong."

It identifies problems. It doesn't offer paths forward.

Feedback that grows does something different. It:
- Names what's working specifically (so the student knows what to keep doing)
- Identifies where growth is happening (so they see their own trajectory)
- Points toward next steps (so they have somewhere to go)

It's less about judgment and more about navigation.

## Examples in Practice

Let's say a student submits a draft of something written.

**Judgment feedback:**
"B+. Good ideas but needs more development in the second section. Some grammar issues."

**Growth feedback:**
"You're building a really clear argument in your opening - the way you set up the central question pulls me in. I can see you working through the middle section; it feels like you're still figuring out what you want to say there, which is exactly right at this stage. What if you tried talking through that section out loud before revising? Sometimes that helps clarify what's central. The grammar stuff will come with revision - don't worry about that yet."

Same observations. Different orientation.

The first tells the student where they are. The second invites them to keep moving.

## Your Voice Matters

I'm not giving you a script. Scripts are weird. Students can tell when you're performing feedback from a template.

What I'm offering is a stance. An orientation. The actual words need to be yours.

Think about how you naturally talk to people. What does encouragement sound like in your voice? What does "I see you trying" sound like when you say it?

The goal isn't to sound like someone else. It's to find your authentic way of communicating: "I see your journey. Here's what I notice. Here's where you might go next."

## Your Third Task

Write sample feedback for three hypothetical student submissions.

Imagine three different scenarios:
1. A student who clearly put in effort but is struggling with the core concept
2. A student who got the basic idea but rushed through without depth
3. A student who did strong work and is ready for a bigger challenge

For each, write feedback that:
- Is in present tense
- Focuses on growth, not judgment
- Names something specific that's working
- Points toward a next step
- Sounds like *you*, not like a template

Read your feedback out loud. Does it sound like something you'd actually say? Does it feel like an invitation to keep growing?
