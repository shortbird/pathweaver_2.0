# Lesson 3: Supporting Without Shaming

Some students struggle. That's not a problem to solve - it's a reality to hold.

The question is: how do you support someone who's struggling without making them feel like something is wrong with them?

## The "Behind" Problem

When someone struggles in most learning environments, we call them "behind."

Think about that word. Behind implies a race. A position. Other people are ahead.

Even when we're trying to help, the framing is: you're behind, let's get you caught up, let's close the gap.

Students hear: you're failing at a race everyone else is winning.

That's not supportive. It's shaming with good intentions.

## What Struggle Actually Means

Struggle isn't the same as failing. It's not even a bad sign.

Struggle means you're at your edge. You're being asked to do something you can't quite do yet. You're growing.

If there's no struggle, there might not be much learning either.

But students don't experience struggle that way. They experience it as embarrassment. As proof that they're not as smart as others. As something to hide.

That's not about the struggle itself. It's about what the environment has taught them struggle means.

## Reframing Struggle

When you encounter a struggling student, you have a choice.

You can signal: "Something's wrong. Let's fix you."

Or you can signal: "You're doing hard work. Let me walk alongside you."

These lead to very different experiences.

The first creates a helper-helpee dynamic. You have what they lack. You're going to give it to them. The student is the problem; you're the solution.

The second creates a collaborative dynamic. You're both oriented toward the challenge. You have experience that might help. The struggle is the focus, not the student's deficiency.

## Practical Approaches

**Normalize the struggle.** "Yeah, this part is hard. It's hard for most people who engage with it seriously." Not as comfort. As truth.

**Locate the struggle, not the student.** "The tricky part here is X" instead of "You're struggling with X." The struggle is in the content, not in the person.

**Ask before helping.** "What would be useful right now?" Maybe they want guidance. Maybe they want space. Maybe they just want to be heard. Don't assume.

**Share your own struggles.** If you've wrestled with something similar, say so. "I remember being stuck on this kind of thing. It took me a while to see it differently." Not as one-upmanship. As solidarity.

**Resist urgency.** The impulse is to fix it quickly. Get them caught up. But rushing sends the message: your struggle is a problem that needs to be solved fast. Sometimes the most supportive thing is patience.

## What About Real Problems?

Sometimes a student isn't just at their learning edge. They're genuinely overwhelmed. Or they've gotten lost in a way that requires significant support.

That's real. You can't reframe everything into "struggle is good."

But even here, the stance matters.

"Let's figure out what happened" instead of "You got behind."
"What support would help you?" instead of "You need to catch up."
"Where are you actually?" instead of "Where should you be?"

The student is still a person on a journey. Not a problem to be solved.

## Your Third Task

Think about students who struggle in your learning environment - now, or in the past.

How will you support them without making them feel "behind"?

Write out your mentorship approach. Consider:
- What language will you use?
- What will you avoid?
- How will you frame struggle?
- How will you offer support without creating a savior dynamic?
- How will you resist urgency?

Be specific. Imagine a real situation - or remember one - and write about how you'd handle it.

This isn't just about techniques. It's about the stance you bring. The belief underneath the behavior. What do you actually think about students who struggle? Your answer to that shapes everything else.
