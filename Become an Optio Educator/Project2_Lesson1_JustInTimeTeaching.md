# Lesson 1: Just-in-Time Teaching

There's a particular kind of course I used to build. You probably know the type.

It started with "foundations." Three weeks of theory before anyone touched anything real. Background reading. Vocabulary lists. Historical context. The idea was: students need to understand the basics before they can do the work.

It made sense to me. You can't run before you walk, right?

Except here's what actually happened: by the time we got to the interesting stuff, half the class had checked out. They'd sat through weeks of "this will matter later" and their brains had correctly identified it as low-priority information. When they finally needed that foundational knowledge, they'd forgotten it. Because of course they had. They learned it in a vacuum.

## The Front-Loading Problem

This is what most education does. Front-load.

Dump a bunch of information at the beginning. Cover everything someone might need. Then hope they remember it when the moment comes.

It doesn't work. Not because students are lazy or forgetful, but because that's not how learning sticks. Information without immediate application is just noise. Your brain knows this, even if your lesson plan doesn't.

Think about how you actually learn things in real life.

When you need to fix something in your house, you don't take a comprehensive home repair course first. You Google the specific problem. You watch a video about *that* thing. You learn exactly what you need, right when you need it.

That's just-in-time learning. And it works because the knowledge has somewhere to go immediately.

## Flipping the Model

Just-in-time teaching means designing backwards from what you'd expect.

Instead of: "Here's everything you need to know. Now go apply it."

It's: "Here's what you're going to do. Here's exactly what you need to do it."

The lesson exists to serve the task. Not the other way around.

This feels risky. What if they need more? What if I didn't cover something important?

But here's the thing: if they need more, they'll seek it out. Because now they have a reason to. The gap in their knowledge isn't theoretical anymore - it's blocking them from something they're actually trying to do.

That's motivation you can't manufacture with front-loading.

## What "Minimum Viable Knowledge" Actually Means

When I say "give them exactly what they need," I don't mean dumbing things down. I mean precision.

Ask yourself: What is the smallest amount of information that would let someone succeed at this specific task?

Not "succeed brilliantly." Not "understand all the nuances." Just: get through it. Learn by doing.

If you're teaching someone to make their first website, they don't need to understand the history of HTML. They need to know: here's how you make a heading, here's how you make a paragraph, here's how you make it show up in a browser.

Everything else can come later. *Will* come later, if they're engaged. But only after they've experienced the satisfaction of making something work.

## The Anxiety of Letting Go

I'll be honest: this approach made me nervous at first.

I was trained to be comprehensive. To anticipate every question. To never let a student encounter something I hadn't prepared them for.

But comprehensive usually means overwhelming. And "preparing them for everything" often means they're prepared for nothing, because they've forgotten it all by the time it matters.

Just-in-time teaching requires trusting the process. Trusting that students will ask when they need more. Trusting that encountering a gap in knowledge *while doing the work* is actually a better learning experience than being pre-filled with information they didn't know they needed.

This is uncomfortable if you're used to being the expert who covers everything. But it's also liberating. You don't have to predict every possible confusion. You just have to give them enough to start.

## A Practical Example

Let's say you're designing a project about data visualization.

**Old approach (front-loaded):**
- Week 1: History and theory of data visualization
- Week 2: Types of charts and when to use them
- Week 3: Tools overview (Excel, Tableau, etc.)
- Week 4: Design principles
- Week 5: Finally, make a visualization

**Just-in-time approach:**
- Task 1: Find a dataset that interests you
  - *Lesson: Here's where to find public datasets. Here's what makes a good one.*
- Task 2: Make your first chart
  - *Lesson: Here's one tool. Here's how to make a basic bar chart. That's it.*
- Task 3: Tell a story with your data
  - *Lesson: Here's what makes a visualization tell a story vs. just show numbers.*
- Task 4: Get feedback and revise
  - *Lesson: Here's how to ask for useful feedback.*

See the difference? Every piece of information has immediate relevance. There's no "learn now, use later." It's all "learn now, use now."

## Your First Task

Before you start building your course in Optio, I want you to think about your first move.

You're going to create a course with a title and description. But not the kind you're used to writing.

Most course descriptions are promises. "By the end of this course, you will..." They're selling an outcome. A future.

I want you to try something different. Write a title and description that invites curiosity. That makes someone want to *start*, not just finish. That suggests the experience itself will be interesting, not just useful.

This is harder than it sounds. We're trained to sell outcomes. But if the process is the goal, the invitation has to reflect that.

Sit with these questions:
- What would make someone genuinely curious about this topic?
- How can you hint at the experience without promising specific results?
- What's interesting about the journey, not just the destination?

Your course description is the first thing learners see. Make it an invitation to explore, not a contract for outcomes.
