# Lesson 2: Evidence Over Proof

Last lesson was heavy. You looked at what's broken.

Now let's look at what could be.

## Proof vs. Evidence

There's a subtle but important distinction between asking students to *prove* they learned something and asking them to share *evidence* of their learning.

Proof implies a courtroom. Defend yourself. Convince me. Be judged.

Evidence implies a portfolio. Show me your journey. Let's look at what happened.

Same word family. Completely different energy.

## What Evidence Looks Like

Evidence of learning isn't a single score on a single day. It's a collection of artifacts that tell a story.

It might include:
- Work in progress, not just finished products
- Multiple attempts, showing growth over time
- Reflections on what was hard, what clicked, what changed
- Real things made for real purposes, not just exercises
- Different formats that fit different learners

The key shift: evidence shows the process, not just the outcome.

A student struggling with writing doesn't submit one polished essay. They share their messy first draft, their revisions, their notes about what they changed and why. The evidence isn't "I can write well." It's "here's how I'm becoming a better writer."

## Designing for Process

This changes how you design tasks.

Instead of: "Write an essay about X" (one chance, one product, one grade)

Try: "Document your growing understanding of X" (ongoing, cumulative, evolving)

Instead of: "Complete this project" (did you or didn't you)

Try: "Show me what you tried, what worked, what didn't, what you learned" (the whole journey matters)

The task itself invites evidence rather than demanding proof.

## Multiple Paths to Demonstration

Different students learn differently. They also demonstrate learning differently.

One student understands something deeply but freezes on tests. Another performs well under pressure but struggles with long-form projects. Another expresses understanding best through conversation, or building, or teaching others.

When you offer only one way to show learning, you're not just assessing the content - you're assessing whether the student fits your chosen format.

Evidence-based assessment means offering multiple paths. Not as accommodations for the exceptional, but as the default for everyone.

## The Quality Question

"But how do I know if it's good enough?"

This is where educators get nervous about evidence-based approaches. Without a rubric, without a grade, without clear criteria - how do you know if someone has learned?

Here's the uncomfortable truth: you never really knew. The grade gave you an illusion of knowing. A student got a B, so they must have learned 83% of the material. What does that even mean?

Evidence-based assessment is honest about uncertainty. It says: here's what this student can show me about their journey. Here's what they seem to understand. Here's where they're still growing.

That's actually more information than a grade. It's just less tidy.

## Celebration, Not Certification

There's one more shift that matters.

Traditional assessment certifies. "This student has demonstrated competence level X."

Evidence-based assessment celebrates. "Look at what this student has done. Look at how they've grown."

Certification is backward-looking and final. Celebration is present-tense and ongoing.

A student sharing evidence of their learning should feel like they're being witnessed, not judged. "I see you. I see what you did. I see how you're changing."

That's a different relationship than grader and graded.

## Your Second Task

Choose one task from a course you're designing (or have taught before).

Design three different evidence options for that task. Three different ways a student could demonstrate their learning.

The key: focus on process, not just outcomes.

Don't ask: "What would prove they completed this?"
Ask: "What would show their journey through this?"

Maybe one option is written reflection. Maybe another is a recorded walkthrough. Maybe another is a collection of attempts over time. Make them genuinely different - not just the same thing in different formats.

When you're done, look at your three options. Do they celebrate process? Do they leave room for different kinds of learners? Do they feel like invitations or tests?
