# Lesson 3: Designing Lessons That Serve Tasks

You have your projects mapped out. Now comes the part that makes or breaks just-in-time teaching: the lessons themselves.

This is where most of us revert to old habits. We sit down to write a lesson and suddenly we're back in front-loading mode. "I should probably explain the background..." "Let me just add this context..." "They might need to know..."

The lesson grows and grows. By the time you're done, it's a comprehensive guide to everything tangentially related to the task. And students will skim it, if they read it at all.

## One Question to Rule Them All

Before you write anything, ask: **What's the minimum a student needs to succeed at the next task?**

Not "what's everything they might find useful." The minimum.

This is uncomfortable. It feels like you're leaving things out. Like you're not being thorough.

But thoroughness isn't the goal. *Doing* is the goal. The lesson exists to get students into the work as quickly as possible, with just enough to start.

If they need more, they'll discover that need while doing the task. And that's when additional learning actually sticks.

## Immediate Applicability

Every sentence in your lesson should connect to something the student will do.

If you write a paragraph and can't point to how it helps with the upcoming task, delete it. Save it for later. Or let it go.

This is painful. I know. Some of that cut content is genuinely interesting. Some of it is context that would help if they remembered it.

But "would help if they remembered it" is exactly the problem. Front-loaded context gets forgotten. Information delivered at the point of need gets used.

Imagine you're teaching someone to cook their first meal. You could explain the Maillard reaction, the chemistry of caramelization, the history of the ingredients.

Or you could say: "Put oil in the pan. Wait until it shimmers. Then add the onions."

Both are true. One gets dinner on the table.

## Structure for Just-in-Time

Here's a simple structure that works:

1. **The Hook** (1-2 sentences): Why should they care about this right now?
2. **The Core** (as short as possible): What do they need to know to do the task?
3. **The Bridge** (1-2 sentences): How does this connect to what they're about to do?

That's it. Save the depth, the nuance, the "going deeper" for resources they can explore *if they want to*.

The lesson is a launch pad, not a library.

## What "Comprehensive" Gets Wrong

I keep coming back to this because it was my biggest blind spot.

I used to think being a good teacher meant being comprehensive. Covering everything. Not letting students encounter something I hadn't prepared them for.

But comprehensive lessons train students to be passive. They learn to wait for instruction instead of seeking it out. They learn that someone else is responsible for giving them everything they need.

Just-in-time lessons train students to be resourceful. They know they'll get enough to start. They know that gaps are normal. They learn to identify what they need and go find it.

Which kind of learner do you want to create?

## A Before-and-After

**Before (front-loaded):**

"In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamentals of user research. User research is a crucial component of the design process, originating from the human-centered design movement of the 1990s. There are several types of user research: quantitative, qualitative, generative, and evaluative. Each serves a different purpose in the design process. Quantitative research involves numerical data and statistical analysis, while qualitative research focuses on understanding behaviors, motivations, and experiences through observation and interviews. Before conducting any research, you'll need to understand your research questions, select appropriate methods, recruit participants, and prepare your materials..."

**After (just-in-time):**

"You're going to talk to someone about how they use a product.

That's it. One conversation. Find someone who uses something you're curious about - an app, a tool, a service - and ask them about their experience.

You don't need a formal method. You just need genuine curiosity and a few good questions:
- Walk me through the last time you used this
- What was frustrating? What was satisfying?
- What did you expect to happen? What actually happened?

Don't try to solve anything. Just listen. Write down what surprises you.

This is user research. Everything else is refinement."

Same topic. Same eventual depth possible. But one gets them doing research in five minutes. The other creates a wall they have to climb first.

## Your Third Task

Pick one of your projects and write a lesson for it.

Keep it short. Shorter than feels right.

Ask yourself:
- What's the minimum they need to succeed at the first task?
- Is every sentence immediately applicable?
- Could someone start the task after reading this? (Not "do it perfectly" - just start?)

The goal is a lesson that feels like a doorway, not a wall. Something that launches into action, not delays it.

After you write it, read it again with fresh eyes. Find the sentences that are "nice to know" rather than "need to know." Cut them. It'll hurt. Do it anyway.
