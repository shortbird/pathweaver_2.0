# Lesson 4: Walking Your Own Path

You've built something. A course skeleton. Some lessons. But here's a question: Have you experienced it?

Not reviewed it. Not proofread it. *Experienced* it.

There's a difference between looking at a map and walking the trail. Builders need to be walkers too.

## The Curse of Creator Knowledge

When you design something, you know too much.

You know what you meant. You know the connections you were making. You know where it's all headed.

Students don't know any of that. They're encountering it fresh. And the experience they have might be completely different from the one you imagined.

This is hard to see from the inside. You need to find ways to step outside.

## The Preview Tool

Optio has a preview feature with an XP slider. This lets you see your course as a student would see it at different stages.

Move the slider. Watch how your course reveals itself.

At 0 XP, what does a new student see? Is it inviting? Is it clear what to do first?

At higher XP, what opens up? Does the progression make sense? Does each new project feel earned, or arbitrary?

This slider is a rough simulation of the student journey. It won't tell you everything. But it'll show you things you can't see from the builder's view.

## Reading Your Own Lessons

Try reading your lessons as if you didn't write them.

This is almost impossible, but try anyway. Pretend you know nothing about the topic. Pretend you're slightly confused and a little impatient.

Now read:
- Does this feel like it's *for* me, or *at* me?
- Can I start doing something after this?
- Is anything here that I'd skim over?

If you find yourself thinking "well, they'd understand what I mean" - they might not. Especially if they're bringing different contexts, different experiences, different expectations.

## The Relevance Test

Here's the real question to sit with: Does each lesson feel relevant, or does it feel like required reading?

Required reading is what you assign because you're supposed to. Students can smell it. They do the minimum. They check the box.

Relevant content is what students *want* to consume because it helps them do something they're trying to do. There's no box to check. There's just... this is useful right now.

The difference is often subtle. It's in the timing. It's in the framing. It's in whether the content serves the student's current need or the educator's idea of what they should know.

## What the Walk Reveals

When I first started doing this - actually experiencing my own courses - I was humbled.

Things I thought were clear weren't. Things I thought were exciting were actually boring. Sections I'd labored over felt tedious. And moments I'd thrown together quickly were somehow the most engaging.

The walk reveals what the map hides.

You'll find gaps. Places where students are expected to do something they're not prepared for. You'll find bloat. Places where you explain things they don't need yet. You'll find friction. Places where the flow breaks.

All of this is good. You're catching it now, before real students hit those walls.

## A Note on Perfectionism

This lesson might make you want to revise everything before moving on. Don't.

Preview your course. Notice what you notice. Make notes. But don't disappear into an endless revision cycle.

The goal isn't perfection. The goal is awareness. You're building the muscle of seeing your course from the student perspective. That muscle gets stronger with practice, not with one exhaustive review.

Ship something. Learn from how it actually works. Revise based on reality, not imagination.

## Your Fourth Task

Use the course preview with the XP slider. Experience your course as a student would.

Move through it. Read your lessons. Notice what happens in your body as you do.

Some questions:
- Where do you feel momentum? Where does it stall?
- Does each lesson prepare you for what comes next?
- Or does it feel like homework you have to finish before you're allowed to do the interesting part?
- Where are you tempted to skip ahead?

Write down what you discover. Not to fix everything right now - just to see it.

The best course designers are the ones who never lose touch with what it's like to be a learner. This preview practice keeps that connection alive.
