# Lesson 5: Student Voice and Living It

We've been talking about how *you* assess. But there's another voice that matters more: the student's.

Real learning isn't just about what you observe from outside. It's about what students notice from inside. Their own sense of their growth. Their own understanding of what they're becoming.

If we never ask for that, we're treating students as subjects to be measured, not people on a journey.

## The Reflection Turn

Self-reflection is a skill. Most students haven't been taught it.

They've been taught to ask: "What does the teacher want?" "What's the right answer?" "How will this be graded?"

They haven't been taught to ask: "What did I actually learn?" "How am I changing?" "What's different about how I see this now?"

These are different muscles. And like any muscle, they develop with practice.

## Prompts That Open

Some reflection prompts are better than others.

Bad prompts feel like performance. "What did you learn from this project?" invites students to list things they're supposed to say they learned. It's still about being evaluated.

Good prompts feel like exploration. They invite students to actually notice something, not just report.

Compare:

**Closed:** "What skills did you develop in this project?"
**Open:** "What can you do now that you couldn't do before? Or think about differently?"

**Closed:** "What was the most valuable part of this experience?"
**Open:** "What surprised you about working on this?"

**Closed:** "Rate your understanding of the material."
**Open:** "If you could go back to the beginning and give yourself advice, what would you say?"

The open prompts don't have right answers. They invite genuine introspection.

## Articulating Growth

There's something powerful about putting growth into words.

When students articulate what they're learning - out loud or in writing - it becomes more real. More owned. They're not just receiving feedback from others; they're generating insight about themselves.

This is different from "proving competence." It's not about convincing anyone they've learned. It's about making their own learning visible to themselves.

"I used to think X, and now I think Y."
"This part was hard at first, and now it's becoming more natural."
"I notice I'm asking different questions than I was before."

These aren't performances. They're discoveries.

## Creating Safe Space for Honesty

For reflection to work, students need to trust that honesty won't hurt them.

If they think "I'm still confused about this" will lower their grade, they won't say it. If they think "I struggled with this" sounds like failure, they'll pretend they didn't.

You create safety by how you respond to vulnerability.

When a student says something honest - "I didn't really get the point of this project" or "I'm not sure I learned what I was supposed to" - that's gold. That's trust. Meet it with curiosity, not correction.

"Tell me more about that. What did you think the point was supposed to be?"
"What do you think you *did* learn, even if it wasn't what was intended?"

These responses honor the reflection while opening new understanding.

## Your Fifth Task

Design a reflection prompt that helps students articulate their own growth.

Not a prompt that asks them to prove competence. Not one that sounds like an assessment question in disguise.

A prompt that genuinely invites them to notice something about their own learning. About how they're changing. About what they're discovering.

Write the prompt. Then write a brief explanation of what you hope it will invite. What kind of thinking do you want it to spark?

## The Final Step: Living It

Everything you've designed in this project - evidence options, feedback approaches, re-engagement strategies, reflection prompts - exists on paper right now.

Paper is nice. Reality is better.

At some point, you need to actually use this stuff. With real students. In real situations.

That's your final task for this project.

---

## Your Sixth Task

Take your new assessment approach - whatever pieces of it feel ready - and use it with actual students.

This doesn't have to be a complete overhaul of everything you do. It could be:
- Offering one task with multiple evidence options
- Writing growth-focused feedback on one set of submissions
- Trying your new reflection prompt with one group

Document what happens. Not just what the students do, but what you notice about yourself. Is it harder than you expected? Easier? Different in ways you didn't anticipate?

This documentation becomes part of your own evidence of learning. You're not just teaching differently; you're learning about teaching.

When you complete these tasks, you've finished Project 3.

You've examined what traditional assessment misses. You've designed for evidence over proof. You've practiced feedback that grows. You've thought about how to reach students who disappear. And you've tried it for real.

This is what rethinking assessment actually means. Not just new techniques, but a new relationship to the question of "did they learn?"

The answer isn't a grade. The answer is a story. And students should be the ones telling it.
