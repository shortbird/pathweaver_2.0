# Lesson 5: Fresh Eyes and Shipping

You've built something. You've walked through it yourself. Now it's time to let someone else see it.

This is where a lot of us get stuck. The course isn't ready yet. Just a few more tweaks. Let me fix that one thing first.

That impulse is understandable. It's also a trap.

## Why Peer Review Matters

You can only see your own blind spots by not seeing them. That's what makes them blind spots.

Another educator looking at your course will notice things you literally cannot notice. They'll get confused where you thought it was clear. They'll ask questions you assumed were answered. They'll feel the friction you've become numb to.

This isn't about criticism. It's about data. Peer feedback is the fastest way to see your work from outside.

## What to Ask For

"What do you think?" is a terrible feedback question. It invites vague niceness or useless generalities.

Instead, ask specific things:

**Philosophy alignment:**
- Does this feel like "the process is the goal" or like "do this to get that"?
- Where does my language slip into future-focused or external-validation territory?
- Does the tone feel like an invitation or an assignment?

**SDT elements:**
- Is there real choice here, or fake choice?
- Does the challenge level seem right? Too easy? Too hard?
- Is there connection - to self, to others, to something meaningful?

**Just-in-time teaching:**
- After reading each lesson, do you feel ready to start the task?
- Was anything confusing because I assumed knowledge you didn't have?
- Was anything tedious because I explained more than you needed?

Give your peer these questions. Ask for specifics, not general impressions.

## How to Receive Feedback

Here's the hard part: your instinct will be to defend.

"Oh, I see why that was confusing, but what I meant was..."
"Well, if you read more carefully, you'd see that..."
"That's just because you don't know the context..."

Resist.

When someone's confused, they're confused. Your intentions don't matter. The explanations you didn't include don't help. The course has to work for people who bring exactly the context they bring.

The most useful stance is curiosity: "Interesting that it landed that way. Tell me more about what you experienced."

Feedback isn't judgment. It's information. Treat it that way.

## The Act of Publishing

At some point, you have to ship.

Not when it's perfect. It won't be. Not when you're certain. You won't be.

You ship when it's good enough to learn from. When real students experiencing the real course will teach you more than any additional revision.

In Optio, publishing creates a completion badge for your course. This is a small thing with surprising significance. It means someone can *finish*. It means there's something to achieve.

Think about that badge for a moment. When a student earns it, what do you want that to mean? Not just "completed requirements" - but really mean? What kind of experience do you want them to have had?

That's worth sitting with before you hit publish.

---

## Celebration, Not Fanfare

Publishing doesn't have to be a big announcement. It can just be... done.

Tell a few people. Invite some early learners. Watch what happens.

The celebration isn't in the launch. It's in seeing your course actually work. In getting that first completion. In learning what you didn't know you didn't know.

That's the process. And - you know how this goes - the process is the goal.

## Your Final Tasks for This Project

**Task 5: Peer Review Exchange**

Share your draft course with another educator. If you're going through this certification with a cohort, pair up. If not, find a colleague who's willing to look.

Give them the specific questions from earlier in this lesson. Ask for honest feedback focused on:
- Philosophy alignment
- SDT elements (choice, competence, connection)
- Just-in-time teaching effectiveness

And offer to do the same for them. Giving feedback is as valuable as receiving it - maybe more. You learn to see courses differently when you practice looking at them critically.

**Task 6: Publish Your Course**

Based on the feedback you received, make refinements. Don't try to fix everything - just the things that matter most.

Then publish.

Notice how it feels. Notice the badge that gets created. Think about the students who might earn it.

You made something. It's out there now. That's not a small thing.

When you finish these tasks, you've completed Project 2.

You've designed a course using just-in-time principles. You've experienced it yourself. You've gotten fresh eyes on it. You've shipped.

This is what it means to be an Optio educator: someone who designs for the learner's journey, not just the content map.

The course might not be perfect. Good. It doesn't need to be. You'll learn from every student who takes it. And that learning - the ongoing process of getting better at this - is exactly the point.
