# Lesson 2: Mapping the Journey

Once you have a course that invites curiosity, you need to figure out what happens inside it.

This is where a lot of educators default to content organization. "What topics do I need to cover? In what order?" It's logical. It's also backwards.

In Optio, courses are made of projects (we call them quests). And projects aren't content containers. They're experiences.

## Projects as Destinations

Think of each project as a meaningful destination on a journey.

Not "Chapter 3: Advanced Concepts." That's a filing system. Instead: "Build something that matters." "Solve a real problem." "Create and share."

A project should feel like an accomplishment in itself. Not just a step toward something else. Not just "you need to do this to unlock the next thing."

When a student finishes a project, they should have *made* something. Figured something out. Done something they couldn't do before. The project is the point - not just a waypoint to somewhere else.

## Sequencing That Serves Learning

The order of your projects matters. But not the way you might think.

Traditional curriculum sequencing is about prerequisites. "You need to know X before you can do Y." This creates hierarchies. Gates. Bottlenecks.

Learning journey sequencing is different. It asks: What sequence creates the best *experience*? What order builds confidence, curiosity, momentum?

Sometimes that means starting with something simple. Sometimes it means starting with something exciting, even if it's harder. The "right" sequence depends on what you're trying to create for the learner.

Questions to consider:
- What would hook someone at the start?
- What builds on what naturally?
- Where might someone feel stuck? What could come before that to prevent it?
- What's a satisfying ending?

## XP Thresholds: Gentle Direction and Motivation

In Optio, you can set XP thresholds for projects. This determines when students can access each project.

You've arranged your projects in a specific order for a reason. Maybe Project 2 builds on concepts from Project 1. Maybe you want students to build confidence before tackling something more challenging. XP thresholds are your tool to gently enforce that intentional sequence.

Think of thresholds as guide rails, not brick walls. They say: "Here's the path I've designed for you. Trust me - there's a reason for this order."

But thresholds do something else too: they motivate.

For students, seeing a project they *can't quite access yet* creates anticipation. It's a goal on the horizon. "I need 50 more XP to unlock that one." That's engaging. That's something to work toward. It turns the course into a journey with milestones, not just a list of things to do.

The key is calibration. Set thresholds that:
- Enforce your intended sequence without creating frustration
- Give students clear, achievable targets to aim for
- Create a sense of progression and accomplishment

You're not trying to block anyone. You're creating a path and giving students the motivation to follow it. When a student earns enough XP to unlock the next project, that moment should feel like an achievement - because it is.

## The Trap of Too Many Projects

When you're excited about a topic, it's easy to over-design.

"Oh, they should definitely do something on X. And Y is crucial. And I'd be doing them a disservice if I didn't include Z."

Suddenly you have twelve projects and a year-long course.

Restraint is a design skill.

Ask yourself: What are the 2-3 experiences that would transform how someone thinks about this? Not "cover the material" - transform how they *think*.

Start there. You can always add more later if students are hungry for it. But you can't un-overwhelm someone who looks at your course and sees an endless mountain.

Less is often more. A few deep experiences beat a dozen shallow ones.

## Your Second Task

Now you're going to build the skeleton of your course.

Add 2-3 projects. That's it. Resist the urge to add more right now.

As you create each project:
- Give it a title that signals experience, not content
- Write a description that invites, not assigns
- Think about the sequence - why this order?

Use the drag-and-drop to arrange them. Feel how they flow into each other.

Set XP thresholds that feel encouraging. Low enough that students don't feel blocked. High enough that there's some sense of progression.

This is your course's backbone. Keep it simple. Keep it focused on the journey.
