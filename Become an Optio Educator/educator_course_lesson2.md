# Lesson 2: The Three Keys to Motivation

If you did the reflection in Lesson 1, you probably noticed some patterns.

The joyful learning had something the obligatory learning didn't. But what exactly?

Psychologists have been picking at this question for decades. Two researchers in particular - Edward Deci and Richard Ryan - spent their careers on it. What they came up with is called Self-Determination Theory, and it's annoyingly simple once you hear it.

There are three things. That's it. Three psychological needs. When they're met, people are motivated. When they're not, even interesting stuff feels like a slog.

## The Three Things

### 1. Choice

People need to feel like they're making real decisions.

Not fake choices. Not "you can do the assignment in blue pen or black pen." Actual agency over something that matters.

When I was teaching, I thought I was giving students choices all the time. "You can pick any topic for your project!" But then I'd give them a rigid rubric, a specific format, and a narrow definition of success. So the "choice" was basically which flavor of the same thing they wanted.

Real choice looks more like: Which quest do you want to pursue? How do you want to show what you learned? What evidence feels right to you?

The research on this is pretty clear. When people feel controlled - even by well-meaning teachers with good intentions - motivation tanks. When they feel autonomous, they engage.

### 2. Competence

The challenge has to be right.

Not too easy (boring). Not too hard (frustrating). There's a sweet spot where you're stretching but not breaking. Psychologists call it the "zone of proximal development," which is a mouthful, but the idea is simple: you want challenges that are just beyond what someone can do comfortably, but not so far beyond that they feel hopeless.

This is harder to design than it sounds. Different students are in different places. What's a stretch for one person is impossible for another. But when you nail it - when the challenge is *just right* - there's this thing that happens. People lean in. They want to figure it out.

Competence isn't just about difficulty, though. Students also need to:
- Know what they're aiming for (clear expectations)
- Be able to see their own progress
- Feel their skills actually growing

If they can't tell whether they're getting better, the motivation fades even if the challenge is right.

### 3. Connection

This one's easy to overlook.

People need to feel like the learning connects to something - to themselves, to others, to something they care about.

This isn't the same as "making it relevant" in that forced way teachers sometimes do. ("You'll use algebra when you're calculating tips!" Sure.) It's deeper than that. It's about whether students can bring their own experience into the work. Whether they see themselves in it. Whether it feels like *theirs*.

Connection also means community. Are they learning alone, or with others? Do they feel like they belong somewhere, or are they just isolated individuals being evaluated?

## When All Three Show Up

Here's what I've noticed: when choice, competence, and connection are all present, something shifts.

Students stop asking "do I have to do this?" They start asking "can I do more of this?"

It's not magic. It's just... how motivation works. Deci and Ryan didn't invent this - they just documented it. It's been true forever. We've just been building educational systems that ignore it.

Think back to your joyful learning experience from Lesson 1. I'd bet money that all three were there:
- You chose to do it (or at least chose how)
- The challenge was in your range
- It connected to something real for you

And the obligatory experience? At least one was missing. Probably more.

## Your Next Tasks

Okay, two things:

**Task 2: Philosophy Deep Dive**

Read the full core philosophy document. It's not long. Then create some kind of visual summary - a mind map, a sketch, a diagram, whatever works for your brain.

The goal isn't to memorize anything. It's to make these ideas yours. When you have to draw something, you have to actually understand it.

Your visual should capture:
- "The process is the goal"
- The three keys (choice, competence, connection)
- How they fit together

**Task 3: The Three Keys to Motivation**

Think of a specific time when someone (a student, a colleague, yourself) was deeply engaged in learning. Like, genuinely into it.

Now analyze that experience:
- How was **choice** showing up?
- How was **competence** being supported?
- How was **connection** present?

Be specific. Don't just say "they had choice." Say what the choice actually was. The more concrete you can be, the more useful this analysis becomes when you're designing your own stuff.

**Read:**
- [Self-Determination Theory and the Facilitation of Intrinsic Motivation](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf) - The actual paper. It's academic but readable. Skim it at least.
- [Zone of Proximal Development](https://www.simplypsychology.org/zone-of-proximal-development.html) - Good explainer on the competence sweet spot.
- [Core Philosophy Document](/core-philosophy) - **Read this before Task 2.** It's got the practical applications of everything we've covered.

**Go Deeper:**
- *Why We Do What We Do* by Edward Deci - SDT from its creator. Surprisingly readable for an academic.
- *Mindset* by Carol Dweck - Everyone's read this, but if you haven't, you should. It's mostly about the competence piece.
