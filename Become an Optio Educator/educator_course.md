## The 4 Core Projects

---

### PROJECT 1: "Embracing the Philosophy" (450 XP)

**Quest Focus:** Understanding and internalizing "The Process Is The Goal" and Self-Determination Theory

**Key Concepts:**
- **"The Process Is The Goal"** - Learning is valuable for what it teaches you RIGHT NOW
- **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)** - Motivation comes from Choice, Competency, and Connection
- **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** - At Optio, every student gets an IEP. Same material, different paths.

| # | Task | Description | XP | Pillar |
|---|------|-------------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Reflect on Your Learning Journey | Write about a time when learning felt like joy vs. obligation. What made the difference? Consider: Did you have choice? Was the challenge right? Did you feel connected? | 50 | Life & Wellness |
| 2 | Philosophy Deep Dive | Read the core philosophy document and create a one-page visual summary or mind map that captures both "The Process Is The Goal" and Self-Determination Theory | 75 | Language & Communication |
| 3 | The Three Keys to Motivation | Think of a student (or yourself) who was deeply engaged in learning. Analyze the experience through SDT: How was Choice present? How was Competency supported? How was Connection fostered? | 75 | Life & Wellness |
| 4 | Language Inventory | List 10-15 phrases you commonly use when teaching. Identify which ones focus on future payoff, external validation, or comparison — and which ones celebrate present growth | 75 | Language & Communication |
| 5 | Rewriting Your Voice | Transform your future/external phrases into present-focused, internally-motivated alternatives that still sound like you | 100 | Language & Communication |
| 6 | Universal Design Reflection | Think of a student without an IEP/504 who needed individualization the system didn't provide. How would you have supported them if flexibility was the default? What would have been different? | 75 | Life & Wellness |

**Evidence Suggestions:** Personal reflection (with SDT analysis), visual summary or mind map, motivation analysis, language inventory worksheet, transformed phrases document, UDL reflection

### PROJECT 2: "Designing Your First Course" (400 XP)

**Quest Focus:** Hands-on course creation using Just-in-Time Teaching principles

**Key Concept:**
- **Just-in-Time Teaching** - Lessons provide exactly what students need to complete tasks, delivered at the moment of need. No front-loading. No "learn now, apply later."

| # | Task | Description | XP | Pillar |
|---|------|-------------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Course Foundation | Create a new course with a title and description that invites curiosity rather than promising outcomes | 50 | Language & Communication |
| 2 | Map Your Projects | Add 2-3 quests as projects. Consider the learning journey — what sequence makes sense? Use drag-and-drop to arrange them and set XP thresholds that feel encouraging, not gatekeeping | 100 | Language & Communication |
| 3 | Just-in-Time Lesson Design | Within one of your projects, create a lesson that prepares students for the tasks ahead. Ask yourself: What's the minimum they need to succeed? Write content that's immediately actionable, not comprehensive | 100 | Language & Communication |
| 4 | Experience as a Learner | Use the course preview with the XP slider. Move through your course as a student would. Does each lesson prepare you for the next task? Does it feel relevant or like required reading? | 75 | Life & Wellness |
| 5 | Peer Review Exchange | Share your draft course with another educator. Give and receive feedback focused on philosophy alignment, SDT elements, and just-in-time teaching | 50 | Society & Culture |
| 6 | Publish Your Course | Refine based on feedback and publish. Notice the completion badge that's created — how might you celebrate students who earn it? | 50 | Language & Communication |

**Evidence Suggestions:** Published course link, lesson content sample (annotated with just-in-time rationale), preview experience reflection, peer feedback exchange notes

### PROJECT 3: "Rethinking Assessment" (400 XP)

**Quest Focus:** Moving from grades/rankings to evidence portfolios and growth celebration

| # | Task | Description | XP | Pillar |
|---|------|-------------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Assessment Autopsy | Reflect on traditional assessment in your experience. What did it measure? What did it miss? | 50 | Life & Wellness |
| 2 | Evidence vs. Proof | Design 3 different evidence options for one of your tasks that celebrate process, not just outcomes | 50 | Language & Communication |
| 3 | Feedback That Grows | Write sample feedback for 3 hypothetical student submissions — present-tense, growth-focused, in your voice | 100 | Language & Communication |
| 4 | When a Student Goes Quiet | A student hasn't completed anything in three weeks. Write how you'd reach out — acknowledging without shaming, inviting without pressuring, curious without interrogating | 100 | Life & Wellness |
| 5 | Student Voice Integration | Design a reflection prompt that helps students articulate their own growth (not prove competence) | 50 | Language & Communication |
| 6 | Try It Live | Use your new assessment approach with real students. Document what happens | 50 | Life & Wellness |

**Evidence Suggestions:** Assessment reflection, evidence options document, sample feedback examples, re-engagement message draft, reflection prompt design, live trial notes

### PROJECT 4: "Building Learning Community" (400 XP)

**Quest Focus:** Creating environments where curiosity thrives and comparison fades

| # | Task | Description | XP | Pillar |
|---|------|-------------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Community Audit | Examine your current learning environment. Where does comparison creep in? Where does celebration shine? | 75 | Society & Culture |
| 2 | Design a Celebration | Create a specific ritual or activity that celebrates learning process (not achievement ranking) | 100 | Arts & Creativity |
| 3 | Mentorship Model | Identify how you'll support students who struggle without making them feel "behind" | 75 | Life & Wellness |
| 4 | Facilitate Your Celebration | Run your celebration activity with learners. What did you discover? | 100 | Society & Culture |
| 5 | Reflect and Iterate | What would you do differently? What surprised you? | 50 | Life & Wellness |

**Evidence Suggestions:** Community audit notes, celebration activity design, mentorship approach document, facilitation reflection
