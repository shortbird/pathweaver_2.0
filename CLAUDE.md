I always test in production, not locally. I don't ever use the app locally, so don't give me instructions to do so.
Always commit and push yourself unless I tell you otherwise.
Core philosphy: "The Process Is The Goal."
The diploma page is the core offering of Optio. It is what students will put on their resume to showcase their 
education. It will be used to verify task completions, as the goal is for accountability to come from knowledge that 
the evidence will be made available publicly.

Their diploma is as impressive as they make it, so if they skimp on recording or doing things well it will reflect poorly on them when other people evaluate their work.

This needs to be well designed and reflect well on the Optio brand. This will be the first exposure to our brand for many people, so it needs to clearly communicate the nature of a self-validated diploma, why they're valuable, and what information they can learn about the student.
