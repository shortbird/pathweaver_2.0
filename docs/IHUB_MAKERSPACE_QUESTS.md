# ihub Utah Makerspace Quest System
**Implementation Plan - January 2025**

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive quest system designed for students ages 13-21 participating in the in-person makerspace program at ihub Utah (https://www.ihubutah.org/). The quest system is designed to help students explore the full range of resources, equipment, and professional expertise available at ihub.

**Program Philosophy:** "The Process Is The Goal" - These quests emphasize exploration, hands-on learning, and community connection rather than just completion.
