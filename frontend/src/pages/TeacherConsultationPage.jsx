    {
      question: 'What happens during the free 30-minute consultation?',
      answer: 'You\'ll meet via video with a licensed teacher to discuss your child\'s current learning situation, goals, interests, and challenges. They\'ll ask questions about your family\'s schedule, learning philosophy, and what success looks like for you. It\'s a judgment-free conversation focused on understanding your needs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are your teachers actually licensed and experienced?',
      answer: 'Yes! All our advisors are state-licensed teachers with experience in both traditional classroom settings and alternative education models (homeschool, online learning, project-based learning). Many have advanced degrees in education.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I have to use Optio\'s platform after the consultation?',
      answer: 'Not at all! The consultation is completely free with no strings attached. If you find the conversation valuable and want continued advisor support, we offer premium plans where your advisor stays involved. But there\'s no pressure or obligation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if my child has special learning needs?',
      answer: 'Our advisors have experience with diverse learners including students with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, giftedness, and anxiety. During the consultation, let us know about any learning differences so we can match you with the right advisor.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you help us transition from traditional school to homeschool?',
      answer: 'Absolutely! Many families we work with are making this transition. Your advisor can help you deschool, choose curricula, set realistic expectations, and create a plan that doesn\'t replicate the problems you left behind.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if we\'re already homeschooling and just need a refresh?',
      answer: 'Perfect! Advisors help established homeschoolers too. Whether you\'re hitting a rough patch, your child is changing developmental stages, or you just want fresh ideas, a consultation can provide new perspective.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What comes after the free consultation?',
      answer: 'After the call, you\'ll receive a written summary of recommendations and next steps via email. If you want ongoing support, we\'ll explain how advisor access works through Optio\'s paid plans. But again, the consultation itself is completely free and you can implement the advice however you choose.',
