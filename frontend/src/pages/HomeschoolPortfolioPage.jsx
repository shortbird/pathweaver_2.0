    {
      question: 'How is Optio different from other homeschool tracking tools?',
      answer: 'Optio combines portfolio building, transcript generation, and gamification in one platform. Unlike basic logbooks, we help you create a professional college-ready portfolio with visual progress tracking, evidence documentation, and shareable links.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I track multiple children on one account?',
      answer: 'Yes! Your parent account can link to multiple student accounts. Each child gets their own portfolio, transcript, and progress tracking.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if we\'re already mid-year? Can we add past work?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. You can backdate activities and upload evidence for work already completed. Many families start by documenting their current semester, then gradually add historical work.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to use specific curricula for this to work?',
      answer: 'No! Optio works with any curriculum: purchased programs (Khan Academy, Time4Learning), textbooks, unit studies, unschooling, Charlotte Mason, Classical, or eclectic approaches. You define what counts as learning.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the transcript work for college applications?',
      answer: 'Optio generates official-looking transcripts showing courses, credit hours, and grades (if you choose to assign them). You can customize course names and descriptions to align with college expectations. Many colleges accept parent-issued transcripts from homeschoolers.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is my student\'s information private and secure?',
      answer: 'Yes. Student portfolios are private by default. You control what\'s shared publicly. We never sell data or show ads to students. Your homeschool records are yours.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s included in the free account?',
      answer: 'Free accounts include full platform access with no restrictions: unlimited quests, evidence uploads, progress tracking, transcript generation, portfolio building, and all core features. Create your account and start using the complete system today.',
