                This Agreement governs the Participant's enrollment in Optio Academy, our in-person educational
                program located in Provo, Utah. Its purpose is to create a clear understanding of the Academy's
                unique model, mutual responsibilities, financial commitments, and operational policies.

                We provide access to facilities, mentorship, the Optio digital learning platform, and a
                framework for entrepreneurial development. We do not provide direct supervision or assume
                custodial care. The Participant is expected to be self-motivated and take primary responsibility

                By signing this Agreement, you explicitly acknowledge and agree to the following terms:
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Innovation Center Model</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Academy is structured similarly to a recreational or innovation center. The Participant
                is paying for access to the facilities, resources, digital learning platform, and the opportunity
                to interact with staff and mentors.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">No Supervision or Custodial Care</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Optio Academy DOES NOT provide childcare, babysitting, or custodial supervision for any
                Participant, regardless of age. Staff and mentors are present to provide educational and
                entrepreneurial guidance through the Optio platform and in-person mentorship, not to monitor
                or supervise Participants.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Freedom of Movement - Open Campus</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Academy operates as an OPEN CAMPUS. Participants are free to arrive, depart, and move
                about the premises and surrounding areas at will during program hours.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">No Monitoring of Arrival or Departure</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Academy staff DO NOT monitor when Participants arrive or leave the facility. We are not
                responsible for ensuring a Participant's attendance on any given day. Participants are
                expected to manage their own time and attendance.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Parental Responsibility for Transportation</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Parents are solely responsible for the Participant's transportation to and from the facility.
                The Academy DOES NOT verify the identity of the person picking up a Participant. It is the
                Parent's responsibility to coordinate safe transportation and communicate authorized persons
                directly with their child.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Actions Outside the Academy</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Academy is not responsible for the Participant's actions or safety when they are off-site,
                even if they leave during normal operating hours. Students have the freedom to leave the
                premises as part of the open campus model.

              </p>

                On behalf of themselves (the Parent), their heirs, and their estate, the Parent releases,
                waives, and agrees not to sue the Academy, its officers, employees, mentors, and agents
                for any loss, damage, or injury arising from the inherent risks of participation.

                Participant (minor) may have against the Academy for injuries caused by the Academy's
